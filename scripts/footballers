Aaron Rodgers GB (4)	1	3.1	339.93	1.5	TIER 1	QB	Every full season, besides last year, Rodgers has finished as the QB1 or QB2. It's unlikely he becomes an actual value in regular drafts, but if recency bias poisons your draft and causes him to drop, even this late round QB drafter is going to snatch him up.
Cam Newton CAR (7)	2	3.05	339.49	4.17	TIER 1	QB	Coming off a career passing year with over 3800 yards and 35 touchdowns. Expecting him to be great for fantasy but those drafting and expecting him to duplicate last year's success could be disappointed. It's a difficult thing to match the best season of your career.
Russell Wilson SEA (5)	3	5.06	327.47	2.37	TIER 1	QB	Has been a fantasy star in multiple ways. Once with his rushing TDs, and last year with high passing efficiency. A safe QB with a very high ceiling despite the lower volume.
Drew Brees NO (5)	4	5.1	314.5	2.87	TIER 2	QB	The Saints have replenished the weapons for Drew Brees, bringing in Coby Fleener in free agency and Michael Thomas in the draft. Brees still has juice left in the tank and should not be overlooked because of his age.
Andrew Luck IND (10)	5	4.1	310.42	4.83	TIER 2	QB	No way around it, Luck was awful last year before the kidney incident. With only one full season of elite QB play, investing an early pick in Luck carries risk.
Carson Palmer ARI (9)	6	7.03	291.21	3	TIER 3	QB	Led the league in YPA last year. Palmer won't be a secret this year, but he's still in a very high powered offense. Look for a season similar to last year, grab if the value is right.
Blake Bortles JAC (5)	7	7.11	288.67	6	TIER 3	QB	Bortles is definitely on regression alert. He should still be a solid fantasy producer with the weapons around him, but an improved defense could limit Bortles "garbage time" opportunities.
Eli Manning NYG (8)	7	8.04	287.6	2.63	TIER 4	QB	Coughlin is out. McAdoo is in. Eli has a tendency to have absolute stinkers, but is generally solid. The continued emergence of OBJ and the drafting of Sterling Shepard has Eli looking at another solid year.
Ben Roethlisberger PIT (8)	9	6.04	282.85	5.3	TIER 4	QB	For his career, Big Ben has played 16 games in 3 seasons. 3 out of 12 seasons. Combine his health risk plus only 2 seasons of throwing over 30 TDs, he may not be worth the high pick investment.
Jameis Winston TB (6)	9	11.1	282.83	5.07	TIER 4	QB	The youngest QB to ever throw for over 3000 and 4000 yards. Things really seemed to click in the 2nd half of the year for Winston. Another offseason with Mike Evans and company could see Winston becoming more than a matchup streamer.
Philip Rivers SD (11)	11	8.11	281	3.4	TIER 4	QB	Old Man Rivers was playing out of his mind with volume last year. He was carrying fantasy teams until Keenan Allen went down. While last year's passer volume shouldn't be expected, the Charger's defense and running could see Rivers passing a ton again this year.
Tyrod Taylor BUF (10)	12	10.11	280	7.03	TIER 5	QB	Does Buffalo believe in T-Mobile? He wasn't the most consistent fantasy QB, but the threat of his legs and the 2nd half breakout of Sammy Watkins makes Taylor an intriguing fantasy QB for next season.
Andy Dalton CIN (9)	13	11.09	275.65	5.17	TIER 5	QB	Was making a run at the overall QB1 last year before breaking his thumb. The Bengals have lost some weapons, but still have the elite A.J. Green. Likely to fall pretty far in drafts, despite last year's success and finishing as the QB3 just a few years ago.
Ryan Fitzpatrick NYJ (11)	14	13.06	275.6	5.7	TIER 5	QB	The magic beard is back in New York. The fantasy community rejoiced with much celebration. He was a very capable fantasy QB, and suprisingly consistent. Granted it was basically the best season his career. However, expect the gunslinging to continue and Fitz should be a solid late round QB target.
Tom Brady NE (9)	15	6.07	273.67	4.5	TIER 5	QB	#DeflateGate! With Brady now suspended for 4 games, he's going to be an overbearing burden on a small bench. Remember, 4 games is nearly 30% of the regular season for most fantasy leagues. But, if you have a large bench (6 or more) and he falls into double digit rounds, he could become a steal.
Matthew Stafford DET (10)	16	11.02	274.74	4.47	TIER 5	QB	Remember when Stafford threw for over 5000 yards and was the next big thing in QBs? That was so awesome...5 years ago. To be fair, Stafford has been quietly ok for fantasy players, not great, and now you throw in the loss of Calvin "Megatron" Johnson. Some value here, but meh.
Matt Ryan ATL (11)	17	12.02	268.44	3.43	TIER 5	QB	He was bad last year...wasn't he? Surprisingly right in the zone for attempts and yards, it was the touchdowns that tanked Ryan's fantasy value. He is a candidate to emerge in his 2nd year in the Kyle Shanahan system, but is definitely a drafter beware.
Derek Carr OAK (10)	18	9.05	271.68	4.3	TIER 5	QB	Was surprisingly solid for a stretch of last season. Could be a surprise of the year if Amari Cooper takes the next step and Crabtree continues to return to form.
Marcus Mariota TEN (13)	19	12.12	266.33	6.17	TIER 5	QB	Was quite efficient last year before the injury, on pace for around 4000 yards. A dynamic playmaker that could find himself buried for fantasy underneath the "exotic smashmouth" style of football his "head coach" wants to play.
Kirk Cousins WAS (9)	20	10.05	268.97	5.73	TIER 5	QB	Will the real Kirk Cousins please stand up? 1st half of the season, ho hum. 2nd half of the season, carrying fantasy players to a title. He seems to ride the wave of his confidence so watch his first few games closely. If he starts hot, get on the train. Faceplants Week 1? Jump off. He's basically the QB version of Groundhog Day.
Tony Romo DAL (7)	21	10.03	266.71	5.17	TIER 5	QB	Always underrated for real football and fantasy. Romo was a league winner in 2014. If his collarbones can hold up, he will yet again provide late round value, but will have some lower scoring weeks during the season.
Colin Kaepernick SF (8)	22	0.00	268.33	8	TIER 6	QB	Will Kappy be the man? Or will it be Blaine Gabbert? CK is still coming off of surgery but there were whispers from the bushes that new coach Chip Kelly really likes him. He has the tools to run Chip's system to a high level, does he have the mind for it?
Ryan Tannehill MIA (8)	23	13.12	259.17	6.43	TIER 6	QB	Oh what could have been with Ryan T?? He actually improved his efficiency and total passing yards, but the big jump never came. On top of that the rushing yards went way down. Adam Gase is coming to town and has coached Peyton and Jay Cutler to some of their best years. It's a longer shot, but it's still possible for Tannehill...maybe...kinda
Jay Cutler CHI (9)	24	0.00	256.5	5.03	TIER 6	QB	Smoking Jay Cutty was begrudgingly kept by Chicago due to a wisely crafted contract. This could be Cutty's last ride in Chicago, but surrounded by Alshon and White and a 'Joe Cool' attitude, Cutler has QB2 value.
Joe Flacco BAL (8)	25	14.01	243.41	3.73	TIER 6	QB	The Ravens led the league in pass attempts in 2015. You did not read that wrong. Likely a product of a bad defense, but Marc Trestman is still there. If any of the WRs can step up, Flacco will have his streaming moments.
Alex Smith KC (5)	25	0.00	252.19	2	TIER 6	QB	Alex Smith is the epitome of 'if you ain't first, you're last' in fantasy football. Because he either gives you a solid QB1 performance, or he tanks your week. As always, in the right matchup Alex Smith gives your team a chance to win.
Brock Osweiler HOU (9)	27	0.00	232.95	6.53	TIER 7	QB	New life goals. Do something about 8 times and then get paid $70 million to do it. At least the Texans are going full force to help him succeed. The skill positions are loaded for Houston, young and inexperienced, but loaded. Not great odds, but BO could have fantasy value.
Robert Griffin CLE (13)	28	0.00	233.05	7.37	TIER 7	QB	Can the Masters of Metrics save RG3's career? He's going to be surrounded by young talent and a solid head coach. There is the real chance of turning Coleman into his 2013 Pierre Garcon. Expect Griffin to be a game manager in a run heavy offense.
Blaine Gabbert SF (8)	29	0.00	183.57	6.83	TIER 7	QB	It is still unclear who will be the starter for the 49ers. Whoever it is will get to enter into the usually productive Chip Kelly offense. The problem here is there is a lack of offensive weapons to throw the ball to. If you want a 49ers QB, you will be able to take one late, but we would recommend bypassing this tandem unless you're in a 2QB league.
Mark Sanchez DEN (11)	30	0.00	212.67	8	TIER 7	QB	
Sam Bradford PHI (4)	31	0.00	208.2	8.7	TIER 7	QB	From Sammy Biscuits, to Sammy Diapers. If he manages to dry his tears with his guaranteed $22 million dollar contract and go compete, maybe he can keep his starting job. Hot Stat: Bradford has earned $1 million per TD in the NFL...
Teddy Bridgewater MIN (6)	31	0.00	214.33	3.43	TIER 7	QB	Teddy Brosevelt. A decent, possibly good, real life QB. A bad, possibly terrible, fantasy QB. The addition of Treadwell is great. But was the basement level passing volume because of the system, or because there was nobody to throw to? A fantasy breakout here seems highly unlikely.
Jared Goff LA (8)	33	0.00	174.17	5.83	TIER 7	QB	The Rams paid the Iron Price to move up for Goff. It cleary will remain to be seen if that price was worth it in the next few years. But for fantasy football this year, Goff has to near hands off. A rookie QB coming in to play for Jeff Fisher, a coach that hasn't produced a top half offense in almost a decade, won't lead to fantasy points.
Brian Hoyer CHI (9)	34	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 7	QB	Backup for Smoking Jay Cutty! Bad for your health, but good chances you'll get to see the field.
Carson Wentz PHI (4)	35	0.00	24.33	7	TIER 7	QB	
Nick Foles LA (8)	36	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 7	QB	One thing comes to mind when the name Nick Foles is mentioned....superstar.
Case Keenum LA (8)	36	0.00	15	9	TIER 7	QB	Got protected by a 1st round option. Got replaced by the 1st overall pick.
Josh McCown CLE (13)	38	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 7	QB	Could still win the job for Cleveland. Was actually a pretty decent fantasy play due to a gunslinger mentality. If Josh Gordon could get on the field with Corey Coleman, McCown is going to let it rip with regularity and could be a fantasy surprise.
Paxton Lynch DEN (11)	39	0.00	15	9	TIER 7	QB	Paxton Lynch is going to play at sometime this year. It could be far worse for a rookie than getting to start games for the reigning Super Bowl champions. The skill players are there for Paxty to succeed, but he's probably not going to.
Geno Smith NYJ (11)	40	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 7	QB	Please no. Just. Please. No.
David Johnson ARI (9)	1	1.05	222.03	4.83	TIER 1	RB	The savior for several fantasy players last year. Johnson showed major potential, albeit in a very small sample size. That coaching staff has verbally committed to DJ as the 3-down back for the high powered AZ offense, but we haven't seen it. He will cost a first round pick, looks tremendous on paper, but carries a useage risk.
Todd Gurley LA (8)	2	1.05	224.3	3.33	TIER 1	RB	As soon as he got on the field, Gurley was everything that fantasy players thought he could be. A punishing RB in a run first offense. He does have some potential limitations as he wasn't featured in the passing game. But as far as workload and touchdown potential, it's hard to get better than Gurley.
Jamaal Charles KC (5)	3	2.03	212.97	5.07	TIER 1	RB	Another ACL tear for Mr. 5.0 YPC. The red flags here are real and justified given the age, injury history, and draft equity it will take to get Charles. But we believe he can come back and continue to be a fantasy stud. The KC backups (West/Ware) showed they were capable, so expect Charles to be given more sideline time than usual. Charles is still among the top fantasy options.
Adrian Peterson MIN (6)	4	1.05	212.67	2.17	TIER 1	RB	The machine. If Peterson is in uniform, nothing is going to stop him from being a fantasy stud. Aside from the suspension year, Peterson has never had less than double-digit touchdowns. He doesn't provide much in the passing game, but the Vikings are committed to him. The looming threat of Father Time is the only negative for AP.
Lamar Miller HOU (9)	5	1.09	207.03	4.2	TIER 2	RB	#FreeLamar! We did it America! Miller is going to get his chance to be a fully featured running back. Several coaching staffs were convinced that Miller shouldn't have that responsibility. Time to find out if Bill O'Brien is smarter than those previous Dolphin coaches (spoiler alert, we think he is).
Ezekiel Elliott DAL (7)	6	1.1	201.43	3.37	TIER 2	RB	Start the engines for they hype train! The Cowboys went all in on their guy EZ-E with the 4th overall pick. Teams aren't going to take a RB that high to sit and learn for a few games. It's trial by combat for Elliott. Lucky for him, he gets to run behind the best offensive line in the NFL and get the ball handed to him by one of the better QBs in the league. Elliott will make his way into the 1st round in redraft leagues, perhaps an overpayment, but not everyone comes into the league with the potential to finish as a top-3 fantasy RB.
LeSean McCoy BUF (10)	7	2.08	200.23	3.43	TIER 2	RB	Shady McCoy had a shakeup with the Law that put a fright into keeper and dynasty players. As of now, it appears he won't face any punitive response for the incident in the nightclub. We've been high on Shady all summer, but now with news of Karlos Williams suspension, his draft stock might raise a bit too high. He's still a bell cow running back for a running team and shouldn't cost you a 1st or 2nd round pick.
Mark Ingram NO (5)	8	2.12	195.5	2.5	TIER 2	RB	If someone had told you Mark Ingram would have 50 receptions in 12 games, the year the Saints signed C.J. Spiller, you would have likely laughed in their face. Seemingly overnight, Ingram became ultra reliable as a 3-down running back. There is the chance he doesn't retain that role as much this year, but if he does, he becomes one of the safest RBs in fantasy (aside from injury of course).
Le'Veon Bell PIT (8)	9	1.11	196.18	4.73	TIER 2	RB	Currently looking at a 4 game suspension, Bell is a tough decision now for fantasy players. He's likely still worth a 2nd round value. The last 2 seasons have ended from a major knee injury, so grabbing Lev does come with some risk. But there isn't an RB in fantasy drafts that can match his production and workload.
Doug Martin TB (6)	10	2.11	193.2	4	TIER 2	RB	Well, well, well. Mr. Martin returned to top form in a big way. He finished 2nd in the league in rushing yards and sported a monstrous 4.9 YPC average. He was rewarded with a new contract from Tampa and returns to a budding offense. It should be remembered between his productive years are 2 horrifically bad years. The nice thing is Martin shouldn't cost a first round pick and provides nice upside for an RB in the 2nd round.
Eddie Lacy GB (4)	11	2.07	186.33	4.73	TIER 2	RB	Eddie Lacy went down as a major bust last year. He clearly did not give his all nor devote his offseason to improving his game. Send in our hero Tony Horton of P90X fame to transform Eddie Lacy, into Eddie Money! Looking to cash in on a contract year, expect a sculpted Lacy to show up and be what fantasy players became accustomed to in his first two seasons.
Devonta Freeman ATL (11)	12	2.06	182.17	5.9	TIER 2	RB	Freeman didn't earn the starter role out of training camp. But, when he was handed the 3-down role, he dug in like the talons of a...well..falcon. Finishing as the overall no.1 fantasy RB, Freeman was high volume and especially productive in the passing game. Tevin Coleman still lurks in the shadows, but it would be surprising to see the workload shift away from Freeman at this point.
Latavius Murray OAK (10)	13	3.1	175.5	4.83	TIER 3	RB	The Raiders repeatedly said with words and actions they wanted to bring in 'help' for Latavius. That help came in the form of Deandre Washington, who is not physically built to be a 3-down RB. So it would appear that Murray is safe to be the lead dog in an evolving offense. Murray has the ability and is looking at a workload to be fantasy star again.
Ryan Mathews PHI (4)	14	5.09	167.47	4.8	TIER 3	RB	A guy we feel is being underrated by the community. The Eagles were rumored to be connected to EZ-E, but they decided to trade all of this year and next year's picks to move up for Carson Wentz. This took them out of the RB game. The only RB they added, Wendell Smallwood, is viewed as a scatback. If new coach Doug Pederson runs anything similar to the Chiefs offense, Mathews is looking at heavy involvement. Hopefully his adamantium surgery got scheduled.
Thomas Rawls SEA (5)	15	3.04	163.3	6.2	TIER 3	RB	The NFL draft wasn't as kind to Rawls as it could have been. Over the offseason, Rawls was thought to be the heir to BeastMode. But the Seahawks invested a few draft picks in C.J. Prosise and Alex Collins. Prosise looks set to jump into passing down work, but Rawls should be locked into his 2-down role. Don't reach for him, but no need to be overly concerned about.
C.J. Anderson DEN (11)	16	3.08	165.97	5.9	TIER 3	RB	The ultra-polarizing C.J. Anderson. He was all set to leave Denver until the team had second thoughts and matched a lucrative contract. He burned a ton of fantasy players last year. All signs point to Denver running the ball a ton and Anderson being the main ball carrier. The epitome of high risk/high reward.
Jonathan Stewart CAR (7)	16	5.05	164.1	4.03	TIER 3	RB	Jonathan Stewart hadn't seen the type of workload he had in 2015, well, ever. He wasn't ever a flashy player for fantasy players, his ceiling is capped by the ultimate goal line vulture Cam Newton. However, 8 straight weeks of 20+ carries cannot be ignored. Sometimes your team needs those low ceiling/high floor guys.
Jeremy Hill CIN (9)	18	4.08	161.1	4.87	TIER 3	RB	Hill was close to a major disaster last year. Luckily he finished the year tied for the most rushing touchdowns. Hill didn't look anything like his rookie year, often dancing and indecisive. He is still the goal line back on a solid offense, but will be rightfully hard to trust. Look for a year better than last, but not as good as his rookie year.
Carlos Hyde SF (8)	19	4.03	160.3	5.07	TIER 3	RB	That Week 1 breakout on primetime seems like a REALLY long time ago. Hyde dealt with injuries and an abysmal team for all of 2015. Chip Kelly has come to town, bringing an offense that leads to fantasy production for RBs. If Hyde can hold up, and that's a big IF, he's looking at a very high volume workload.
DeMarco Murray TEN (13)	19	4.04	157.87	3.67	TIER 3	RB	DeMarco was sent packing to the Titans early in the offseason. It wasn't an ideal landing spot as far as high scoring offense, but he was setup for a 250+ carry season. Was being the key word. The Titans grabbed Derrick Henry with a 2nd round pick. Murray is still likely to be the primary ball carrier, but his volume took a major blow.
Matt Jones WAS (9)	24	5.02	147.27	5	TIER 3	RB	Jones was bad. Real bad last year. Between his occasional highlight plays were numerous plays of inefficiency. But, knock knock says Opportunity. Alfred Morris is gone and Jones is being talked up like a true workhorse RB. He has the catching chops to do it, but the draft cost for him will cause him to be a risk.
Jeremy Langford CHI (9)	21	5.01	152.03	6.9	TIER 4	RB	The tape is lacking, but the opportunity won't be. Langford volumed his way to a stretch of fantasy awesomeness last year while Matt Forte was injured. The Bears did add Jordan Howard in the draft, and some see him as a workload threat. As of now, Langford is set to prove that opportunity can can outweigh talent for fantasy.
Matt Forte NYJ (11)	22	4.01	150.03	6.03	TIER 4	RB	Chicago told Forte to hit the bricks. The Jets were there with open arms to embrace the veteran. Then they opened their arms to Bilal Powell and Khiry Robinson creating a crowded backfield. Forte has red flags all over, age/workload/new team late in career, but has been one of the most efficient running backs for years. His draft cost helps mitigate some of the risk, but the reward could be huge.
Frank Gore IND (10)	23	6.07	149.53	3.13	TIER 4	RB	Frank Gore finished last year as an RB1...Yes, that Frank Gore. The good news is Andrew Luck will be ready for the season and Gore has little to no competition, looking at you Robert Turbin. The hype surrounding Gore will be far less this year, despite finishing as RB12 last year. Looks like a real value.
Giovani Bernard CIN (9)	25	7.02	141.5	2.7	TIER 4	RB	Gio had a strange season last year. He came out magma hot, capitalizing on the slow start of Jeremy Hill. But then his usage became erratic and couldn't really be counted on. Gio is a PPR stud and is solid for Standard as well. Lots of owners get scared off of true timeshare RBs, use their fear to get a great fantasy player.
Isaiah Crowell CLE (13)	26	9.05	139.93	2.93	TIER 4	RB	Don't give up on Crowell! Hue Jackson has worked magic with a handful of RBs. The Browns seem content to let Crowell and Duke Johnson handle the backfield. His upside is limited to being a 2-down thumper, but there's nothing wrong with that in the place he will be drafted.
Melvin Gordon SD (11)	27	6.03	140.63	5.37	TIER 4	RB	Looking like a superhuman returning from his knee surgery, Gordon looked quite healthy on a huge catch and run that turned into a TD in preseason Week 1. There could be life yet in the second year player. The best part of Gordon is the draft day discount players can have. He's not a lock to return or breakout, but for the price, the upside is worth it.
DeAngelo Williams PIT (8)	27	5.12	135.2	2.5	TIER 4	RB	DWill is going to be the man in Pitt for the first 4 games (assuming Bell doesn't win his appeal, which is unlikely). For those that go in on Bell, he is a great fill in for the early season. It's not going to be cheap however. But to spend a 2nd and a 6th for the Pitt RB production, it's a bit risky, but very high reward if for those that want to jump in.
Dion Lewis NE (9)	30	4.1	139.8	4.77	TIER 4	RB	Lewis was a big winner of the NFL draft. In the midst of a breakout year with the Patriots, fresh off signing a new multi-year contract, Lewis tore his ACL. Most speculated the Pats would add some RB help but they didn't. Lewis was a bit enigmatic last year that even though he was great every week, he was still hard to trust. Fantasy players will likely be scared of Lewis even more. Lewis could become a screaming value.
Rashad Jennings NYG (8)	36	7.03	118.17	5.5	TIER 4	RB	Rashad Jennings finished the year on a tear. He was a top fantasy option the last quarter of the year. The Giants may have found a replacement in Paul Perkins, but that transition is likely to take some time. Jennings is going to provide a solid value for at least the first half of the year, especially if the Giants can manage to pull the plug on the Andre Williams experiment.
Arian Foster MIA (8)	29	5.05	143.53	7.73	TIER 5	RB	Arian Foster has swapped teams with Lamar Miller and is taking his talents to Miami. This throws quite the wrench in Jay Ajayi and Kenyan Drake's value, but the question is, what can Foster do? Will he be the Gase-led veteran star like Knowshon Moreno was? Will he be a worthless veteran leader like Steven Jackson was in Atl? The truth will probably be inbetween. At age 30, coming off of a very difficult injury, switching teams, and a slew of other reasons lead us to believe he will be much closer to Steven Jackson.
Danny Woodhead SD (11)	31	8.01	136	3.63	TIER 5	RB	Always undervalued and underrated for fantasy. Woodhead could possibly be even more involved now with his teammate Melvin Gordon coming off of micro-fracture surgery. If in any kind of .5 or full PPR, Woody should always be a draft target.
T.J. Yeldon JAC (5)	32	8.08	135.2	4.13	TIER 5	RB	One of the biggest perceived losers of the offseason. The Jags stunned the fantasy world by giving Chris Ivory a financially strong contract in a world where teams are getting RB production on the cheap. No one quite knows how the workload will shape out, but Yeldon should remain safe as the pass catching back. Depending on his freefall, he could be a draft day steal.
Ameer Abdullah DET (10)	33	7.08	130.83	4.5	TIER 5	RB	The Abdullah Express never got it's engines rolling last year. The Lions had the lowest amount of rushing yards in the league. But now Joique Bell is gone and Detroit replaced him with a recovering Stevan Ridley. Abdullah is going to be given a chance to be the man in Detroit. Due to the high level degree fantasy burns he dished out last year, he could be a tremendous value.
Chris Ivory JAC (5)	34	6.09	128.5	4.37	TIER 5	RB	Ivory was considered one of the better free agents available this offseason. He ended up taking a nice contract from Jacksonville, a place he knew he wouldn't be the featured back. Judging the workload is a bit of a guessing game right now, but he is likely to be a high priced handcuff and goal line back.
Duke Johnson CLE (13)	35	6.08	122.9	2.7	TIER 5	RB	Duke Johnson didn't have much juice running between the tackles but excelled in the passing game. He caught over 60 balls and is lined up to repeat a high catch season. New Head Coach, Hue Jackson had great success with Jeremy Hill and Gio Bernard. Look for Duke to run in that Gio role.
Charles Sims TB (6)	37	9.03	120.23	2.77	TIER 5	RB	Sims was on a lot fantasy radars his rookie year, but was quickly derailed by an injury and a horrific offense. Sims bounced back strong, finishing as an RB2 despite having to play behind Doug Martin. In case you missed it here's Sims season recap, over 100 carries at nearly 5.0YPC on top of 51 receptions. Don't think of Sims as an expensive handcuff, he's that, but also a player that has standalone flex appeal.
Justin Forsett BAL (8)	38	7.1	117.03	5.7	TIER 5	RB	Forsett was one of the higher drafted backs that struggled at the top of the season. He eventually got his groove going with a couple of monster games, despite a depleted Ravens offense. His season was brought to an abrupt end when Aaron Donald power-bombed him and broke his arm. Concern of Forsett's place on the depth chart is real and valid, but he's a potential starting RB coming at a great value.
Bilal Powell  NYJ (11)	39	9.12	109.97	3.83	TIER 6	RB	Powell came through for fantasy players down the stretch, hauling in 23 receptions over the final four games. His role is unknown at this point as the Jets replaced Chris Ivory with the veteran Matt Forte, who also excels in the passing game. The Jets know what they have in Powell, he will have a role, and that role could expand if Forte struggles.
LeGarrette Blount NE (9)	39	9.08	109.5	4.3	TIER 6	RB	Let's be clear, nobody starts Blount and thinks, "oh yeah, Blount's gonna win this week all by himself!". But that's exactly what he does from time to time. Good luck trying to break through the encryption that is Bill Belichick and know when it's going to happen. It will happen, and Blount is worth a roster spot.
Jay Ajayi MIA (8)	41	8.07	101.53	5.3	TIER 6	RB	The nightmare Ajayi backers were dreading came true. Arian Foster has taken his talents to South Beach. But, a ruptured achilles is an injury that is nearly impossible to see a full recovery from for running backs. Foster already looked as if he had slowed down in the running game. Ajayi could become a decent value now in fantasy drafts. It is still possible for him to be the primary RB for Miami, and Gase has shown he loves to have a guy in the backfield that takes the majority of the work. It's a situation to watch through camp and preseason.
Theo Riddick DET (10)	42	12.06	97.93	2.93	TIER 6	RB	Riddick was an early sleeper favorite before the Lions drafted Ameer Abdullah. Riddick didn't let the rookie get in his way of leading all RBs in total receptions with 80. There's no signs of Riddick slowing down in that role. With Megatron retiring, there could be even more short passes coming his way. Theo Riddick looks to join the ranks of Danny Woodhead as an overlooked RB that bathes in targets.
Darren Sproles PHI (4)	43	12.11	96.88	5.83	TIER 6	RB	A gadget type player that was rumored to be shipped out of town. We always seem to doubt Sproles, but he almost always punches that doubt square in the face. Don't rule him out completely, he's fine to take with a late round pick. But, don't set expectations too high.
Derrick Henry TEN (13)	44	8.09	98.87	4.7	TIER 6	RB	Henry looked very capable in his pro debut, strong, tough, like someone that actually could challenge Murray for carries. This is a situation to watch and feel out. Unfortunatlye, the draft price is way too high for Henry right now, and is likely to go up if he continues to have success.
Shane Vereen NYG (8)	45	0.00	93.33	5.25	TIER 6	RB	It was feast or famine with the passing down specialist. His contract suggests the Giants will keep him around and give him another shot. The biggest value Vereen could bring to a fantasy owner, is having a few good games on their bench and building value to be part of a trade. He can't be trusted.
Javorius Allen BAL (8)	46	0.00	90.67	6.03	TIER 6	RB	Javorius “Buck” Allen had a decent amount of fantasy hype last year and eventually given a starting opportunity. His rushing game left a lot to be desired, but he was solid in the passing game. With Justin Forsett coming back 100% and the team picking up Kenneth Dixon, it's hard to see where Buck fits in.
Tevin Coleman ATL (11)	47	8.11	86.43	4.7	TIER 6	RB	History lesson: Coleman was at the top of the Falcons RB depth chart as a rookie. His first game didn't set the world on fire, but he showed why he was a 2nd round draft pick. A rib injury and a Devonta Freeman catching fire sent Coleman spiraling down the depth chart. Coleman will have his place in the running game, Freeman only averaged 3.12YPC over the final 5 games.
Karlos Williams BUF (10)	48	11.08	81.53	2.73	TIER 6	RB	Karlos Williams came into the offseason as a HOT commodity. He was scoring TDs at an historic rate, played for a run first (and second and third) offensive system and seemed prime to break out. Unfortunately, along with his new baby came 30 extra pounds and a 4 game suspension for substance abuse to start the year. Don't draft Karlos to be anything more than a deep handcuff as he'll waste your bench. He'll be a better waiver wire pickup.
DeAndre Washington OAK (10)	49	11.05	75.63	5.37	TIER 7	RB	Washington provides a very interesting late round value. Oakland was not shy about proclaiming their need to improve at the RB despite Latavius Murray having a decent season. Oakland was rumored to be in the mix for Doug Martin, as well as DeMarco Murray last year. Instead of making a big splash, the Raiders went with Washington in the draft. If Murray falters or gets benched like he did last year, look for Washington to be the benefactor.
C.J. Prosise SEA (5)	50	10.08	79.03	3.97	TIER 7	RB	Prosise was snagged in the 3rd round by Seattle and was immediately talked up as being the new passing downs RB. It makes sense as Prosise is a converted WR, a la David Johnson. Prosise offers a whole lot of upside as the only thing standing in his way of being a 3-down back is a guy who went undrafted, Thomas Rawls.
Chris Thompson WAS (9)	51	0.00	77.63	5.75	TIER 7	RB	Thompson could find himself looking at a decent passing downs job in Washington. He was decently productive before his injury last year. However, whispers in the bushes say Thompson could be looking at finding a new job before the season starts.
Darren McFadden DAL (7)	52	0.00	76	5.03	TIER 7	RB	Welp. The Frankenstein resurrection for Darren McFadden was short lived after the Cowboys used the 4th overall pick on a running back. Once handed the starting job, DMC was actually great. There will still be a place for him in the passing game, but it would take an injury to Ezekiel Elliott for him to have true fantasy value now.
Christine Michael SEA (5)	52	13.07	57.5	5	TIER 7	RB	Truthers unite! What's that? The meeting has been cancelled by C.J. Prosise? Michael could still have a place in the rotation as a bigger back, assuming he can hold off rookie Alex Collins. It's finally time for the members of Team CMike to let the dream die. #NeverForget
Devontae Booker DEN (11)	54	12.06	73.17	6.03	TIER 7	RB	Booker fell a lot further than the draft community predicted he would, eventually being snagged up by the Broncos. The signing of Booker is likely worse for Ronnie Hillman than starter C.J. Anderson. But if Anderson squanders another starting opportunity in the beginning of next year, Booker has the talent to step in a be a bigtime producer.
Zach Zenner DET (10)	56	0.00	71.63	7	TIER 7	RB	The UDFA was just about to get a real chance when his ribs decided to have a party inside of his lungs. The positive news for Zenner, he looks like he will be 100% recovered and ready to go. More positive news, he would only have to beat out Stevan Ridley for the big back job in Detroit. It will still be an uphill climb, but there's a minute chance for Zenner.
Alfred Morris DAL (7)	57	13.06	65.5	5.47	TIER 7	RB	My oh my, just a few months ago things were looking up for the seasoned veteran! Then Jerry Jones and the Cowboys drafted EZ-Eliiott with the 4th overall pick. Morris brings nearly nothing to the passing game, which would be the way for him to stay relevant. All signs point to Morris taking reps only when Elliott needs to catch his breath.
Josh Ferguson IND (10)	57	0.00	69.04	5.73	TIER 7	RB	Josh Ferguson was an undrafted rookie free agent signing this year. That might not sound like much, but the word from Indy is that they were considering drafting him as high as the 4th round. They backed up their belief in him by giving him one of the highest paid UDFA contracts this year. With only old man Frank Gore and currently-in-trouble Robert Turbin ahead of him, he could end up seeing a valuable role this year with a high power offense.
Kenneth Dixon BAL (8)	59	13.02	67.67	6.7	TIER 7	RB	Dixon is one of six running backs currently on the Ravens roster. Six. Granted it won't be that many when the season rolls around, but he's likely to at least begin the season towards the back of the line. Dixon is regarded highly by the draft community and is a candidate to move into a starting role before the season is over.
Jordan Howard CHI (9)	60	14.02	64.57	6.03	TIER 7	RB	The RBs in front of Howard, Jeremy Langford and Ka'Deem Carey, aren't the most talented RBs out there. They do have experience that Howard is lacking. But neither Langford nor Carey have a long history being the primary ball carrier, leaving a glimmer of hope for the Jordan Howard Truthers.
Wendell Smallwood PHI (4)	61	0.00	60.37	6.07	TIER 7	RB	Smallwood joins a thin backfield in Philly. When the season starts, he looks to be behind the fragile Ryan Mathews, and the gadet esque Darren Sproles. The buzz behind Smallwood has been growing lately and with good cause. He should find at least a small role immediately. He could also be this year's Charcandrick West if Mathews goes down (again).
Charcandrick West KC (5)	62	11.01	48.27	4.5	TIER 7	RB	When Jamaal Charles looked for another punch on his ACL card (1 more and he gets a free donut) many fantasy owners laughed maniacally and got ready to unleash Knile Davis. That looked great...until the Chiefs screamed, "CHARIZARD! I choose you!". Char West had some great games, before an injury introduced a timeshare with Spencer Ware. BUT, looks like Ware is the true handcuff to own at this point.
Chris Johnson ARI (9)	63	11.04	52.17	3.5	TIER 7	RB	Chris Johnson showed he still had a bit left in the tank. But the starting job now belongs to David Johnson. Chris remains a decent handcuff with Arizona being among the most potent offenses in the league.
Jerick McKinnon MIN (6)	64	13.02	45.17	3.5	TIER 7	RB	McKinnon has been place on the tortoise track of development. Highly regarded by the metrics community, the team just doesn't seem to have trust in McKinnon, often going to the adorable Matt Asiata instead. McKinnon did see an increase in targets down the stretch and the Vikes could be grooming him for that role, which would make him worthy of a roster spot.
Ronnie Hillman DEN (11)	65	0.00	38.67	6.7	TIER 7	RB	Hillman managed to trick the Broncos into re-signing him over the offseason. To be fair, he had his moments of looking great, but they were sandwiched in between multiple-game long stretches of looking like Ronnie Hillman. With the acquisition of Devontae Booker, Hillman could find himself in a Sisyphus situation at the bottom of the depth chart.
Paul Perkins NYG (8)	68	14.04	52.17	6.03	TIER 7	RB	Perkins is being lauded by many sources as one of the steals of the draft. That would be incredible news for the Giants who are desperate need of a running back they can count on. Jennings is decent but he's 31 and last year was the first time he made it through 16 games. Perkins is a very interesting flier and has the feel of a 2nd half monster.
Terrance West BAL (8)	55	12.1	69.27	8	TIER 8	RB	Rising from the dead like some kind of running back zombie, West is drawing praise from his coaching staff. Originally looked on as the dispensible RB on the Ravens squad, with a solid preseason showing West could find a role for himself. Certainly a player to monitor at the very least.
Ka'Deem Carey CHI (9)	66	0.00	39	6	TIER 8	RB	Carey was given the first offensive snap the game after Matt Forte went down last year. Because he earned it by being an tremendous player you say? No, because John Fox does ridiculous things all the time. Carey will undoubtedly vulture off of Jeremy Langford, because John Fox hates puppies and loves sadness.
James Starks GB (4)	67	13.09	42.33	3.15	TIER 8	RB	If it was ever going to happen for James Starks, it was last year. What I'm saying is, it's not going to happen for James Starks. Expect Eddie Money to show up fully jacked thus relegating Starks to a backup position. He is a decent handcuff for what that's worth.
Alfred Blue HOU (9)	70	0.00	38.33	4.5	TIER 8	RB	Nobody's favorite handcuff. The most one can say about Blue is he's a veteran that will get a solid workload if the starter in front of him goes down. Since it's not Arian Foster anymore, and a much more durable Lamar Miller, Blue's 2016 outlook is not looking good.
Kenyan Drake MIA (8)	71	0.00	39.33	5.07	TIER 8	RB	Drake is an electric talent who wasn't used much in college. His tape shows true NFL breakaway speed, great chops in the passing game, and should be a quality kick returner. After being drafted in the 3rd round, Drake became Jason's second favorite rookie. After hurting his hamstring and Arian Foster's signing, that all changed. It's going to take major injuries in front of him to do anything for fantasy owners in 2016.
Tim Hightower NO (5)	72	14.05	35.33	3	TIER 8	RB	Hightower was exactly what everyone expected last season. He hadn't taken a single NFL snap since 2011, but jumps right into the action and a heavy workload when Mark Ingram went down. The Ballad of Hightower will never be forgotten by those courageous enough to pick him up and start him through the fantasy playoffs. Looks like another solid HAAANDCuff.
Andre Ellington ARI (9)	73	0.00	31.33	6.5	TIER 8	RB	A very unfortunate set of circumstances for Ellington. He was like a flash fire his rookie season, constantly breaking huge runs. He wasn't extremely efficient his sophomore season when he was given a large workload, eventually breaking down. Then he passed by Chris and David Johnson on the depth chart. The juice is there for fantasy production, but the opportunity isn't coming.
Keith Marshall WAS (9)	73	0.00	72.65	6.75	TIER 8	RB	Keith Marshall is the 7th round rookie running back selected by the Washington Redskins. Marshall is extremely fast (we're talking CJ2K combine level fast) and a talented athelete. The biggest knock on Marshall has always been his complete inability to stay healthy. But if he is healthy (as he is in training camp) then he has an opportunity to carve out a role in a pretty empty backfield behind inefficient runner Matt Jones.
Spencer Ware KC (5)	75	13.07	30.43	5	TIER 8	RB	Looks like the heir to the Chiefs RB throne if Charles goes down. Also looks more than capable if that situation arises. Had solid production last year. A solid haaaannddcuufff if that's what you are looking for.
Khiry Robinson NYJ (11)	76	0.00	33.5	2.7	TIER 8	RB	Robinson has flashed on occasion but wasn't able to get a better gig than 3rd on the depth chart for the Jets. If something were to happen to Forte, Robinson would likely get the bulk of the early down work over Bilal Powell.
James White NE (9)	77	0.00	26.83	6	TIER 8	RB	White had the honor of replacing Dion Lewis after the ACL injury. Try as he may, bless his heart, White just didn't have the chops to get it done. He lucked his way into some fantasy production and is still seated in the backup Lewis role, but he should stay on the wire until needed.
C.J. Spiller NO (5)	77	0.00	32	6.5	TIER 8	RB	Shouldn't be written off completely, mostly, but not completely. Worth picking up with a really late pick in the event the Saints decide to work him into an actual gameplan.
Andre Williams NYG (8)	69	0.00	48.93	7	TIER 9	RB	
David Cobb TEN (13)	79	0.00	13.23	8.03	TIER 9	RB	Apparently David Cobb is still on the Titans. Feel free to move on.
Cameron Artis-Payne CAR (7)	80	0.00	24.5	4.5	TIER 9	RB	Artis-Payne was basically a non-factor last season. Even when Jonathan Stewart went down and the stage was set for CAP to make his debut, the Panthers turned to the likes of Fozzy Whittaker and others. Not a starter, not a handcuff.
Damien Williams MIA (8)	81	0.00	19.47	6	TIER 9	RB	
Stevan Ridley DET (10)	82	0.00	24	6	TIER 9	RB	It wasn't a great year for Ridley post ACL surgery. Plenty of time has passed now that Ridley should be fully healthy and his competition for big back duties in Detroit is currently only Zach Zenner. Ridley has some solid sleeper potential to be a 2-down bruiser with goal line potential if he can hold off Zenner.
Joique Bell, FA	83	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Ding dong. Who's there? An aging RB that can't find a new team.
Antonio Andrews TEN (13)	83	0.00	5.83	6	TIER 9	RB	The drafting of Derrick Henry started the beginning of the end for Andrews.
Tre Mason LA (8)	85	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Orleans Darkwa  NYG (8)	86	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Lance Dunbar DAL (7)	87	0.00	4.33	7	TIER 9	RB	The knee injury he suffered on primetime turned out to involve a patella tendon tear. Look for Dunbar to open the season on the PUP list and more than likely not play a single game in 2016.
Denard Robinson JAC (5)	88	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Knile Davis KC (5)	89	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Juwan Thompson DEN (11)	90	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Bishop Sankey TEN (13)	91	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	1st RB taken in the 2014 draft. Yes, that did happen.
Fred Jackson, FA	92	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Mike Tolbert CAR (7)	93	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Chris Polk HOU (9)	94	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Roy Helu OAK (10)	95	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	HELUUUUUUU!!!! ....goodbye
Dexter McCluster TEN (13)	96	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Brandon Bolden NE (9)	97	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Benny Cunningham LA (8)	98	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Daniel Herron, FA	99	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	
Antonio Brown PIT (8)	1	1.01	227.63	1.83	TIER 1	WR	Back-to-back seasons as the no.1 WR. We discovered the only thing that can slow down Antonio Brown, and it was Michael Vick. Thankfully fantasy players don't need to worry about that anymore in the event Big Ben goes down, with Gradkowski coming back and Landry Jones proving he can at least move the offense. 2nd in the league in targets at 193, Brown feels as safe as a fantasy player possibly can.
Julio Jones ATL (11)	2	1.03	225.6	2.67	TIER 1	WR	JULIOOOOOO!! An absolute monster that carries only one concern, and that's his foot. Everything looked great last year. If fantasy owners had anything to complain about, it would be the fact Julio scored only two touchdowns in the final eight games. Look for Matt Ryan to continue to gain comfort in the new offensive system, and look for Julio to compete to finish as the no.1 WR in fantasy.
Odell Beckham Jr. NYG (8)	3	1.03	220.23	2.33	TIER 1	WR	The fears of Beckham being a one-year wonder were silenced after he gave his fantasy owners a scare in Week 1. Beckham is now the motor that moves the Giants offense and he hasn't come anywhere near his ceiling. Target monster, big plays, red zone efficiency, Beckham has everything you want in a fantasy WR. There's no reason to feel after back-to-back top-5 finishes (in his first two seasons) that Beckham should do anything less.
A.J. Green CIN (9)	4	1.08	202.2	1.67	TIER 2	WR	Green is a curious case because he felt like a disappointment, despite finishing as the WR8 and dropping nearly 1300 yards with 10 touchdowns. The disappointment is shown in the points total as Green was clearly a tier or two behind the top finishers. There has been shakeup in Cinci as they lost their run-heavy offensive coordinator, as well as the WR2 and WR3 in Jones and Sanu. It's very possible Green returns to the form of his second and third seasons as a target vacuum. Green does have the longest active streak of having at least 1000 receiving yards (five).
Dez Bryant DAL (7)	5	1.11	199.03	4.83	TIER 2	WR	The dreams of Dez last season, destroyed by a Jones fracture. His foot has now seen multiple injuries in a short time. That's not to say he cannot come back, Julio Jones has been a beast after dealing with the same injury. The previous three seasons before 2015, Dez finished as a top-6 WR. He's nearly a lock for double-digit TDs if he plays a full season. Dez is unlikely to ever get the gaudy target volume of Julio or Brown, but his efficiency and TD scoring overcome that shortcoming.
Brandon Marshall NYJ (11)	6	2.04	196.5	3.5	TIER 2	WR	The Bears were done with Brandon Marshall, but Marshall wasn't done being one the league's premiere WRs. He finished as the WR3 last year in dominant fashion with 14 TDs, tying the league leaders. With Fitz and his magic beard back on board, look for Marshall to have a dominant fantasy season.
Allen Robinson JAC (5)	7	2.01	192.7	4.57	TIER 2	WR	The perfect storm occurred for Allen Robinson last year. Top level talent, a bad defense combined with a mistake-prone QB, and a nonexistent running game led to The Target Monster dropping a line of 80/1400/14. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, the Jags actually appear determined to not be the team they were last year. Similar to Hopkins, the fantasy draft price has been set by last year's success, and the more surprising outcome for this year would be a full repeat of success. Robinson is a stud, but we are more likely to see George Clooney and Marky Mark make a sequel to The Perfect Storm (**Spoiler Alert** They can't because Clooney dies in the movie).
DeAndre Hopkins HOU (9)	8	1.07	187.3	3.07	TIER 2	WR	The talent level of Hopkins can't possibly be questioned at this point. But there was a very clear shift in the Texans team as a whole, halfway through the year. After the debacle against Miami, the Texans defense really turned around, so did the team's rushing yards. Despite losing Foster, the 2nd half of the year the team averaged 110.5 yards a game on the ground compared to 88. Game script turned around for them. Hopkins' numbers took a noticeable dip during this time, and now they throw in the unproven Brock Osweiler. All that said, Hopkins is certainly a WR1, but maybe more of a top-10 guy than a top-5.
Alshon Jeffery CHI (9)	8	3.02	184.27	3.8	TIER 2	WR	Big things were expected from Alshon last year. His soft muscle tissue chose not to fulfill these fantasy wishes. Despite playing only nine games and being hobbled in a lot of them, Jeffery had over 90 targets and over 800 yards. That had him on a pace for a career year. All while playing through injuries that even the most casual football fan would be able to notice. Alshon does have competition coming this year in the form of Kevin White. White hasn't played a single snap of professional football. Jeffery played full seasons the previous two years. Let the recency bias be someone else's problem, Jeffery is a beast.
Mike Evans TB (6)	10	2.08	184.13	4.33	TIER 2	WR	Evans had a solid year, but was a candidate ripe for TD regression and saw the narrative fulfilled to the extreme. He went from 12 TDs on 68 receptions, to only 3 TDs on 74 receptions. The good news for Evans is his QB Jameis Winston showed efficiency improvement over the course of the year. On top of getting better, Winston showed he had little concern to target his stud WR. In six of 15 games, Evans was targeted in the double-digits. Evans went from a regression candidate to a return to the mean candidate.
Sammy Watkins BUF (10)	11	3.09	176.2	6.33	TIER 2	WR	The beginning of the year was riddled with injuries and high variance performances from Sammy. Eventually, the ankle healed up, and the chemistry with Tyrod Taylor lit up. From Week 12 through Week 17 Watkins was the overall WR3, outperforming the likes of Antonio Brown, Allen Robinson, Julio Jones, and Odell Beckham. The red flag would be the extremely low volume with which he succeeded. He averaged under six catches a game in that dominant stretch. The talent is there, but Rex Ryan's scheme could prevent Sammy from consistent top level fantasy production.
Jordy Nelson GB (4)	12	2.05	172.7	4.67	TIER 2	WR	One of the most bizarre injuries of the offseason. Jordy looked like he slipped, runs off the field by himself, ends up having a torn ACL and missing the year. It was extremely disappointing with Jordy coming off a year with his second finish as the overall WR2. There is some slight concern in Jordy's age and recovery, but the Packers are clearly planning on Nelson returning to form. He had played complete seasons in three of the previous four years, and finished as a WR1 in each of them.
Demaryius Thomas DEN (11)	12	3.06	173.7	4	TIER 3	WR	Thomas had set such a high expectation from fantasy owners. Despite catching over 100 passes for over 1300 yards, he felt disappointing. Enter the power of the touchdown! Thomas went from from averaging 12 scores over the last three years, to only six. This production drop relegated him outside of the WR1 in standard scoring. The good news for Thomas, it can't get much worse than the quarterback play he received from Brock Osweiler and Pey-done Manning. The bad news, it appears Thomas should expect a lateral movement in QB play with 'Butt Fumble' Mark Sanchez or rookie Paxton Lynch throwing him the ball. Thomas is still a top talent, but expections should be along the lines of last year.
Brandin Cooks NO (5)	14	3.03	166.03	4.63	TIER 3	WR	Cooks appeared to be on a road trip to Bustsville through the first seven games of the year. In standard scoring, he was averaging just over seven points a game. Then the fantasy deathmatch of the Giants Vs. the Saints happened in Week 8. Through the final nine games, Cooks averaged over 13 points a game. Despite the strong second half, Cooks was not immune to 'crapping your team' with three weeks under four points each. Thankfully Cooks shouldn't cost a first or second round pick, moving him from a highly risky pick, to a solid value.
Amari Cooper OAK (10)	15	2.1	164.53	3.37	TIER 3	WR	Cooper had a sensational season by rookie standards. Only 20 rookies have had over 1000 yards in their first year, and Cooper's 1070 were good enough for the 10th best rookie season of all time. That production includes a leg injury that limited his production over the last quarter of the season, an injury that had the Raiders contemplating shutting him down. There's a few ways people feel about Cooper moving into his second year. Some fear the 'sophomore slump'. While others look at his production, while factoring in Michael Crabtree was often the first read and out-targeted Cooper 146 to 130. There's room for improvement here, but for his ADP, he MUST improve to return value.
Keenan Allen SD (11)	16	2.1	165.3	3.1	TIER 3	WR	At the end of Week 7, Keenan Allen was the overall WR5. In five of those seven games he had double-digit targets. He was able to be the WR5 despite having only three touchdowns at that point. It all came crashing to a halt the next week as he lacerated his kidney on a TD grab. There's no injury concern for Allen heading into 2016. If the target volume can continue, not a ton of reason to believe it can't, then Allen will be a draft steal. The downside compared to the other top WRs is Allen doesn't provide a ton of big plays, he's reliant on that volume.
T.Y. Hilton IND (10)	16	3.05	163	2.67	TIER 3	WR	Hilton is the perfect example of a highly productive fantasy player that not very many fantasy players want to roster. Last year was a bit rough, but Andrew Luck was horrible when he played, and was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck when he was injured. Hilton didn't have much of a chance. And still he dropped over 1100 yards and five TDs. He's had three straight seasons of over 1000 yards. It's probably time for the community to show Hilton some fantasy respect. The ceiling is a low level WR1, but there's enough of a sample now to believe in T.Y.
Michael Floyd ARI (9)	18	5.03	159.23	4.33	TIER 4	WR	Floyd suffered a pretty catastrophic hand injury during training camp where his knuckles reportedly burst through the skin of his hand. I'm not a doctor, but I'd say that's not good for a person that catches a football for a living. He was 'cleared' and ready to play when the season opened, but John Brown was ahead of him on the depth chart. Eventually Floyd caught up to game speed and in the process had 100+ receiving yards in five of his last eight games. Floyd is also in a contract year if that's something you find interesting.
Jeremy Maclin KC (5)	19	4.1	155.9	2.17	TIER 4	WR	The Dirty Cake that is Jeremy Maclin came into a offense that hadn't seen a single WR score a single TD in over a year. It took until Week 3, but Maclin finally put one on the board. He had a really rough stretch in the middle of the year, but the final six games he Hulked out scoring six of his eight touchdowns. He shouldn't be counted on for putting up top end numbers week to week, but he's a very solid WR2 option.
Eric Decker NYJ (11)	20	5.06	151.63	2.33	TIER 4	WR	If anyone was able to score a TD during the offseason, it's Eric Decker. The man is a beast of a red zone weapon. For crying out loud, he got it done when Tim Tebow was his quarterback. With Marshall keeping the top pressure off of him, in the 15 games he played, he DIDN'T score in three of them. That's it. Unfortunately this year the secret is out. His ADP is a bit more resepectable this year, but Decker is a solid WR2 target.
Julian Edelman NE (9)	21	4.06	154.13	4.43	TIER 4	WR	Edelman, like Dez Bryant, suffered a Jones fracture that knocked him out for a good part of the season. He did come back and was highly effective, but has since had another surgery on his foot. The Patriots believe he will be ready sooner than later, but it's a bit of a concern as Edelman's entire game relies on agility and violent planting and cutting. With Tom Brady currently suspended for the first four games of the year, his value could become very attractive knowing he should return to dominance as soon as Brady comes back.
Jordan Matthews PHI (4)	22	7.04	150	5.63	TIER 4	WR	Matthews had high expectations from a lot of fantasy players last season. He did finish as a WR2. He also won the prestigious 'Garbage Man' Footie award from the FootClan. Matthews had a much better 2nd half of the year, similar to his QB Sam Bradford. We have a chicken/egg situation between those two. It could all be for nothing as the Eagles 'took it to the limit' and drafted Carson Wentz. A lot of speculation is floating around if Matthews will continue to man the slot or if he will move outside. The upside exists, the ADP value will likely be there, but the production may not be.
Larry Fitzgerald ARI (9)	23	6.03	148.93	2.33	TIER 5	WR	Larry had to remind everyone that he's making a push to be a Hall of Fame wide out. But it was a tale of two halves for Fitz. Week 1 through Week 8 he was the overall WR3. Week 9 through Week 17 he was the WR34. It's difficult to know what caused the production drop, defensive adjustments, Michael Floyd returning to health, age. It's also to difficult to gauge which half of the year drafters will be paying attention to. If they let him fall in the draft, don't be afraid to scoop him up.
Randall Cobb GB (4)	24	4.01	147.47	4.5	TIER 5	WR	The table was set for Cobb to have the greatest season of his career. He was coming off a WR1 performance. He was being wooed by the Raiders, but took a smaller deal to stay with Green Bay. Then, Jordy Nelson went down in Preseason. The horn had blown and Cobb needed to elevate his game and become the no.1 receiver on the Packers. (Cue Price is Right failure horn). Cobb was exposed as someone that needs to not be the focal point. The good news is Jordy Nelson is coming back and Cobb's ADP will be down because of the '15 debacle. Just remember, both Cobb and Nelson were WR1's in 2014.
Marvin Jones DET (10)	25	8.04	148.1	4.37	TIER 5	WR	Jones will be doing his best to replace future HOF member Calvin Johnson. While that's an impossible task, Jones was considered the top FA wide receiver available this year. He has the size and has shown big play ability (who can forget the four touchdown game). Stafford was quietly one of the best fantasy QBs during the second half of the season, AKA as soon as Jim Bob Cooter took over. Jones is an intriguing player this year and going quite late in drafts. He's near the top of the list for late round WR targets.
John Brown ARI (9)	26	7.02	148.8	3.83	TIER 5	WR	Brown saw his efficiency hit the warp drive in 2015. With two less targets than '14, he improved over 300 receiving yards. It is a bit concerning that nearly 20% of his yards came in Week 6 against the Lions when he dropped 196 against the struggling secondary. Brown is still the third option, but the third option from one of last year's highest producing offenses isn't necessarily a bad thing. Brown is a perfect Flex option.
Kelvin Benjamin CAR (7)	27	3.07	147.27	6.33	TIER 5	WR	Benjamin went down with an ACL injury before beginning his sophomore season. Very unfortunate considering he was coming off a strong rookie year with over 1000 yards and nine touchdowns. The problem is when Benjamin's production occurred during the games. He scored a high majority of his points in the 4th quarter while the Panthers were trailing. Points are points, but that production can't be sustained. But then 2015 became the year of Cam. Many questions surround Benjamin, was he a product of garbage time, how will he fit in an offense that was so prolific last year, will his injury hamper his play?
Doug Baldwin SEA (5)	28	4.12	146	4.63	TIER 5	WR	Doug Freakin Baldwin. In Baldwin's first four years in the league he scored a combined 15 touchdowns. Last year, he dropped 14. 11 of those 14 came in the final six games of the season. It's extremely hard to quantify exactly what happened. In those final weeks Russell Wilson only averaged two more passing attempts more compared to the rest of the season. Drafters seem to be buying into Baldwin, it's hard to blame them but when a player scored 38% of his career TDs in a five week span, all signs point to that being the outlier.
Golden Tate DET (10)	28	4.09	147.03	3.17	TIER 5	WR	Golden Tate has seen has reception volume spike since moving to Detroit and now Calvin Johnson has announced his retirement. Despite the 90 catches Tate had last year, it was a bit of an anomalous year. He only averaged 9.0 yards per catch, the worst of his career. Until last season, he had never been under 10.8 and he had averaged a little over 14 yards per catch the previous three seasons. Tate seems like a lock for at least 100 receptions and could easily finish the year as a strong WR2.
DeSean Jackson WAS (9)	28	8.03	146.33	5.4	TIER 5	WR	DJax was coming off the best fantasy stretch of his career. Injuries basically destroyed his 2015 season. As of now, drafters are forgetting how effective he was before the injuries, letting him plummet in drafts. Absolutely he's still the boom/bust player, but DJax finds a way to boom more than most. He basically played eight full games, and scored in four of them. Cousins isn't afraid to let it rip down the field to Jackson, he's averaging over 19 yards per catch in his two seasons in Washington. He's shaping up to be a draft day value.
DeVante Parker MIA (8)	31	7.1	139.53	6.63	TIER 5	WR	The highly touted prospect saw his rookie campaign derailed by a foot injury and Rishard Matthews. However, when he finally got his chance he did put up some very solid numbers. He averaged over 74 yards a game over the last six weeks and that includes only one clunker. Parker is the type of player that could easily get the Hype Train rolling and see his ADP skyrocket. If it ends up spiraling out of control, it's likely best to pass on the investment.
Donte Moncrief IND (10)	32	5.09	139.33	4.17	TIER 5	WR	Moncrief started the year hot with touchdowns in five of the first seven games. But the breakout dream died shortly after, along with the Colts' offense. Luck was horrible and injured. Hasselbeck did the best he could while the offensive line let him be destroyed on a weekly basis. Luckily Moncrief is still flying mostly under the radar for fantasy players, but the upside is real. If Luck is going to be a stud for fantasy, Moncrief will absolutely be a part of it.
Jarvis Landry MIA (8)	33	4.02	140.17	3.33	TIER 5	WR	A true PPR machine last year, Landry was the go to WR in Miami seeing 165 targets come his way. The Dolphins did clear the coaching house over the offseason, so it remains to be seen if Landry will see that volume type again under Adam Gase. However, even with a slight dip Landry is still a very solid option. It's pretty special when a player can have only four TDs and finish as a WR1. He's very likely to return value on his draft price.
Allen Hurns JAC (5)	34	6.01	138.63	4.83	TIER 5	WR	No other WR had the scoring streak that Allen Hurns had. He caught a TD in seven straight weeks. Along with his 10 touchdowns he had over 1000 yards, not bad for a UDFA. He won't be catching anyone off guard this season and his ADP will reflect that. It would be more of a surprise for him to duplicate last year's success, but the big plays will be there. As an auxiliary piece of a starting lineup, he would be great.
Tyler Lockett SEA (5)	34	7.05	139.17	4.8	TIER 5	WR	The Seahawks traded a lot to move up and grab Lockett. He returned the investment immediately on special teams, becoming the most dynamic kick returner in the league. The first half of the year though, brought little fantasy value as a WR. The second half was a much different story. The first nine games, he had 29 targets. The final 7, he shot up to 40, and his production rose as well. Lockett should be 'locked in' (BOOM) as the second WR in Seattle. If the offense truly runs through Russell Wilson, Lockett can be strong fantasy player.
Torrey Smith SF (8)	34	9.1	139.3	5.97	TIER 5	WR	Smith is being left for dead in San Francisco. Things we do know about Smith, he has had a season of over 1000 yards and a season of double-digit scoring. Kelly will be bringing his high volume offense now leading to a bulk increase in snaps. Boldin and Vernon Davis are no longer around. Smith has talent and opportunity to do some damage.
Emmanuel Sanders DEN (11)	37	6.1	137.67	4	TIER 6	WR	Sanders saw a hefty dip in his production. This shouldn't come as a huge surprise considering he was coming off a career season and dealt with Manning's underwhelming throws and the inexperienced BO. He still managed over 1000 yards for the second year in a row. Sanders is extremely difficult to forecast coming into 2016. He's the second option on a team with anticipatedly bad QB play, though he dealt with that last year. But it also wouldn't be that surprising to see the Broncos move heavier in their run to pass ratio.
Willie Snead NO (5)	38	10.06	137.33	5.03	TIER 6	WR	(Cue The Danger Zone) The Need For Snead ended up as the second best rookie WR for fantasy. It was one of those surprises that shouldn't have been a surprise. Snead finished the year on the cusp of 1000 yards. He looks to be locked as the WR2 for a Drew Brees lead offense. Despite the breakout year, drafters are not paying attention to Snead. The upside is real, and the cost is pennies.
Michael Crabtree OAK (10)	39	8.09	134.13	3.7	TIER 6	WR	Who's laughing now? Crabtree resurrected the the carcass that was his career, and dropped the second best stat line of his career, with the help of Derek Carr and company. Crabtree was the go to possession guy for Oakland last year. The dirty truth from Oakland last year? Crabtree finished as the better fantasy player than Amari Cooper. Looking forward to 2016, it would be no surprise to see Cooper be the man in Oakland, but Crabtree won't be thrown into the trash by the team like he is by fantasy players. He's shaping up like a solid value pick.
Kevin White CHI (9)	40	8.01	129.37	5.7	TIER 6	WR	The seventh pick of the 2014 NFL draft lost his entire rookie season to a stress fracture in his shin. Although if you ask John Fox about it, White is likely still probable. The measurables are off the charts for White, 6'3"/215lbs/ran a 4.35 at the combine. He was raw coming into the draft, so he's still raw now with no game experience, but the upside is tremendous. White won't be the first option as long as Alshon is around, but paired with canon-armed Jay Cutler is fantastic. If his price stays around the 8th round, dive in.
Sterling Shepard NYG (8)	41	8.06	125.27	4.67	TIER 7	WR	It's a good thing when coming out of college a few people are comparing you to rising superstar Odell Beckham Jr. The weird thing is when the team that already has OBJ drafts you. Despite that, the landing spot for Shepard is about as good as it gets. He will immediately slide into the slot, and the Giants run more three wide receiver sets than any team in the league.
Kamar Aiken BAL (8)	42	10.09	125	4.33	TIER 7	WR	Nobody wants to roster Aiken. Nobody wants to play Aiken. However, if Smith isn't ready to go and Perriman struggles in his unofficial rookie year, Aiken is likely to be the beneficiary. Yes the team signed Mike Wallace, a player on his fourth team in five years, clearly NFL teams love him. Aiken wasn't a dominant force by any stretch, but he was a useful piece for fantasy teams.
Vincent Jackson TB (6)	43	11.11	119.33	6.47	TIER 7	WR	Jackson's season was marred by injury and poor play. The truth is he simply may have hit the wall. His production has dropped the past two years. The positive spin for Jackson is he's still the second option on an evolving offense. Winston showed a solid improvement over the year. He's being left for dead by fantasy players, going extremely late. It's unlikely to see him bounceback to elite form, but it wouldn't be all that surprising to see him have a solid year.
Josh Gordon CLE (13)	44	6.04	119.4	9.3	TIER 7	WR	He's back! Sort of! Eventually! Gordon has been reinstated into the NFL but he's going to have to sit out 4 games. He has been out of the league for a while, and the last time we saw Flash he wasn't really tearing it up. But really, there isn't another WR in the area where Gordon is being drafted that has overall no.1 upside. Big risk, big reward.
Terrance Williams DAL (7)	45	0.00	118.57	4.17	TIER 7	WR	Terrence 'TD' Williams had a pretty tremendous opportunity last year with Dez going down for large portion of the year. Unfortunately for him, Romo went down and Williams was left as the no.1 WR for teams lead by Brandon Weeden and Kellen Moore. His total yardage from last year looks ok, until you factor in 21% of it game in the last week of the season. Williams did start 2014 with a flurry of TDs before trailing off. It's unlikely Dallas throws enough to sustain Williams with any consistency.
Devin Funchess CAR (7)	46	12.04	114.33	5.5	TIER 7	WR	When Kelvin Benjamin went down with an ACL in training camp, the immediate Funchess hype grew to legendary proportions. He delivered on the hype only with the exact opposite production. He was an afterthought for much of the season. Moving forward, Funchess paired with Benjamin provides a very unique WR tandem. Neither being overly athletic, but both towering over the average DB. Funchess is simply a flier at this point.
Stefon Diggs MIN (6)	47	9.02	112.23	5.53	TIER 7	WR	Diggs brought the absolute fire for four weeks. But that fire burned bright and fast. Diggs had 84 targets in the 13 games he played. Nearly 50% of those targets came in those first four games. Teams schemed him out of the game plan for Minnesota. Bringing in Treadwell could certainly open things up for Diggs. We've seen the success but it's possible we've already seen the best that Diggs has to offer.
Travis Benjamin SD (11)	48	10.04	111.83	5.17	TIER 7	WR	Benjamin came storming into the fantasy season with three huge games. Eventually the big plays weren't a weekly lock, but a funny thing happened. He turned into the Browns top WR, in a season the team had just dropped a few briefcases of money in a furnace to acquire Dwayne Bowe. Benjamin was getting double-digit target games, he was having productive games, but the touchdowns all but disappeared. Benjamin earned himself a contract with San Diego and looks to take over the role of the now retired Malcom Floyd. He will boom on occasion, but is unlikely to see enough chances to be a weekly start. A decent flex option as an inconsistent executioner.
Markus Wheaton PIT (8)	48	9.1	114.8	4	TIER 7	WR	Some players are jumping all over the late value of Wheaton with Martavis Bryant being suspended the whole year. He will likely slot in as the WR2 on the team with Coates and Heyward-Bey behind him. The problem is Wheaton wasn't effective as a replacement and was actually statistically better in games that Bryant played.
Rishard Matthews TEN (13)	50	14.02	112.33	5.3	TIER 7	WR	Matthews was a pretty big fantasy surprise last year. He managed to keep hyped rookie and first round pick DaVante Parker at bay. Of the 10 full games he played last year, he basically only crapped the bed in two of them. This offseason he was picked up by the Titans. He should automatically become a starter and will see his share of the targets. He's being abandoned on in drafts and could be the savvy pickup from that WR core.
Mohamed Sanu ATL (11)	51	12.05	110.67	4.83	TIER 7	WR	Sanu signed a brand new contract in Atlanta. The fit seems decent, the need was great from Atlanta. But, as far as great fantasy production, it will be hard to expect that from Sanu. In Kyle Shanahan's offense, the second and third WRs on the team simply don't see many targets. In the last three years, non WR1s haven't seen more than 80 targets in the KShy system. Sanu will have solid weeks here and there, but likely a tough player to stash.
Corey Coleman CLE (13)	52	9.06	106.87	5.5	TIER 7	WR	Many believe the landing spot is questionable. While it may not seem ideal, let us not forget a one Josh Gordon managed to be the best fantasy WR on the Browns, so don't let the past of the team destroy your opinion of Coleman. He's an absolute playmaker, and perhaps the most dominant player from the 2016 draft once the ball is in his hands. Travis Benjamin, the teams top WR from last year is gone, leaving a massive target vacuum. Expect Coleman to step into a very large offensive role starting Week 1.
Kendall Wright TEN (13)	56	0.00	101.87	4.3	TIER 7	WR	Wright looked like he could be on his way back into the good graces of fantasy players before going down with injury. A decent PPR type safety valve for Mariota, he has the possibility of seeing a decent number of targets. His upside will be capped by a lack of scoring and the 'exotic smashmouth' offense, but he's interesting at the least.
Dorial Green-Beckham PHI (4)	64	12.07	86.53	5.97	TIER 7	WR	TRADED! The Titans couldn't get rid of their 2015 2nd round pick fast enough and for cheap enough. Perhaps DGB finds new life in Philly, but unless some serious soul searching happens, he looks like a major pro bust.
Laquon Treadwell MIN (6)	53	11.09	103.1	4.5	TIER 8	WR	Draft Twitter's no.1 WR from the 2016 class. But ultimately the fourth WR taken in the draft. The landing spot is great and terrible at the same time. Treadwell comes in to a position of being the man. Teddy Bridgewater hasn't shown the ability to sustain any pass catchers as a true fantasy asset. The question can be asked, was this on Teddy or on the rest of the offense. Minnesota must believe it's on the rest of the offense by grabbing Treadwell in the first round. A weekly TD threat, but likely to be inconsistent this year.
Terrelle Pryor CLE (13)	54	0.00	106.17	7.67	TIER 8	WR	Pryor is an under the radar player who probably won't be drafted in most leagues. But his althetic ability is elite even by NFL standards and his opportunity might be as good as anyone in the league to break out. You could do a lot worse than taking a flier on Pryor at the back of your draft for high upside.
Phillip Dorsett IND (10)	55	13.05	102.2	5.63	TIER 8	WR	Dorsett was one of the strangest picks in last year's NFL draft, as he compared to TY Hilton, who was already on the Colts. He spent last year buried on the depth chart and dealing with injury. He has moved up the chart by default with the absence of Andre Johnson. Things also look up with the information the Colts look to move to more three wide receiver sets. The ceiling will be limited for Dorsett as long as Moncrief and Hilton remain healthy.
Sammie Coates PIT (8)	57	10.07	97.03	6	TIER 8	WR	The sophomore could see a huge jump in playing time with Martavis Bryant getting himself suspended for the year. He's a very athletically gifted player and will be a name to watch over training camp and the preseason. He's being drafted after Markus Wheaton and can very realistically outperform him.
Rueben Randle PHI (4)	58	0.00	99.07	5.7	TIER 8	WR	ROOBS! Randle is basically a fantasy landmine, the kind once you stand on it you can't move because you know as soon you do he's gonna have an explosive game. This trap is best left alone. If he lures you in again it will be because he's now on the Eagles and the team hasn't seem to found it's WR1. Matthews may or may not simply be a glorified slot WR and Agholor underwhelmed in terrific fashion. The mantra of those that draft Roobs - Abandon all hope 'ye who enter.
Chris Hogan NE (9)	59	14.01	93.33	6	TIER 8	WR	Hogan was given a decent contract from the Pats after the Bills surprisingly decided not to match the free agent offer. Hogan should take over immediately for Brandon Lafell as the WR2 and deep threat. This has been a very productive fantasy role, even for Lafell a few years ago. Hogan is being drastically overlooked and holds some nice late round upside.
Ted Ginn CAR (7)	60	0.00	95.03	5.3	TIER 8	WR	Ginn was forced into a much larger offensive role than the Panthers had planned when their WR1 Kelvin Benjamin went down in training camp with a torn ACL.  He responded to the call and was the most productive WR on the team. Before last season, Ginn had scored 11 career receiving touchdowns. He scored 10 in 2015. On only 44 receptions. He's worth a late round flier but he's unlikely to have anywhere near the role he had last year.
Tavon Austin LA (8)	61	11.01	95.17	4.83	TIER 8	WR	Tavon 'The Gadget' Austin finished the year as a WR2. That's right, a top-24 WR, essentially on the back of four great games. If you played him during any of those weeks, you felt like a genius. He's just so inconsistent and on a low-scoring offense to really be given a serious thought to be on your fantasy roster.
Mike Wallace BAL (8)	62	14.03	95.07	7.33	TIER 8	WR	Wallace now finds himself on his fourth team in five years. He was an interesting signing for the Ravens as his best attributes are the best attributes of Rookie-Sophmore Breshad Perriman. The team was forced into a bad position from injuries last year, and clearly they don't want that to happen again. But Wallace's true role on the offense is still a bit of a mystery.
Tyler Boyd CIN (9)	63	13.12	90.97	6.03	TIER 8	WR	Boyd, similar to Will Fuller, gets to plug into a solid offense that already has an elite WR option. Cinci has a lot of targets to makeup as they lost Sanu and Marvin Jones this year. Boyd could be a day one starter if he can beat out veteran Brandon Lafell, but it's a long path to see him in a starting fantasy roster anytime soon.
Pierre Garcon WAS (9)	65	0.00	81.23	6.7	TIER 8	WR	At this point we know for sure who Garcon is. He will get you around 700-800 yards and 5 or so TDs. At this point, not a guy you really want on your roster considering the absence of upside. Washington spent their first pick on Josh Doctson. Doctson will be a threat to take over for Garcon the entire season, and it won't be a surprise if that happens sooner than later.
Will Fuller HOU (9)	65	0.00	81.5	7.2	TIER 8	WR	A pretty cushy landing spot for Fuller. On the Texans he won't have to carry the burden like Coleman or Treadwell right out the gate. He can let Hopkins draw the coverage while Fuller goes to work. The upside for Fuller, the team looks to have gone all in on a higher powered offense bringing in Miller/Osweiler/Fuller. The downside, Fuller has been compared to Ted Ginn....
Nelson Agholor PHI (4)	67	0.00	77.33	5.7	TIER 8	WR	Agholor was gifted/cursed with the expectations to produce similar to previous wide receivers in Chip Kelly's offense. Unfortunately, Agholor was not up to the task. Technically Philly's no.1 WR as far as snaps, he would frequently get the oppositions best outside corner. Poor production and injury have left fantasy players abandoning Agholor and not even looking back to see if he's ok. Now in a brand new offense, Agholor's outcome is murky and meh.
Bruce Ellington SF (8)	67	13.09	83.67	5	TIER 8	WR	Bruce Ellington has had rave reviews in early training camp and is a clear starter for the Chip Kelley offense. With more plays being run per game in a Chip Kelley offense, and the absense of Anquan Bolden, there is an opportunity for some wide receiver to step up and make an impact on fantasy.
Steve Smith BAL (8)	69	11.05	80.33	8.37	TIER 8	WR	Smith is simply a beast. Written off again this year, he looked like he would duplicate on his monster 2014 season. The only thing that can stop Smith is catastrophic injury, and that came in the form of a double ruptured achilles tendon. Smith had announced earlier in the year he would be retiring, but Smith decided an injury wouldn't take him out. An achilles injury is extremely difficult to come back from, even in the prime of an athlete's career. Monitor his health status. He could turn into a second half player you want to acquire.
Brandon LaFell CIN (9)	70	0.00	68	5	TIER 8	WR	After a very strong season with the Patriots, there were actually some expectations for Lafell last year. Unfortunately he started the season on unable to play due to injury. When he finally got on the field, things were unpleasant to say the least. The Panthers version of LaFell showed up, and he was shown the door following the end of the season. He's got another opportunity with the Bengals, who have a pretty strong need in the WR area. Speaking for fantasy, it seems unlikely he will have an impact besides a couple touchdowns here and there.
Andrew Hawkins CLE (13)	72	0.00	75.83	5	TIER 8	WR	
Josh Doctson WAS (9)	73	0.00	75.97	6	TIER 8	WR	A surprise pick for Washington in the draft. The team wasn't considered to be WR needy, so the fact they took Doctson here speaks loudly of their belief in the player. He has a few roadblocks in front of him for this season, namely DJax and Pierre Garcon. However, there is a possibility of one of those veterans being cut before the season, or being sat in favor of the explosive rookie.
Jaelen Strong HOU (9)	74	0.00	71.13	7.33	TIER 8	WR	Strong flashed a bit towards the end of last season. The flash wasn't enough to stop the Texans from spending their first round pick on a WR as well as taking Braxton Miller in the 3rd. Throw on top of that an offseason arrest for marijuana and Strong could find himself on the bench for a long time.
Breshad Perriman BAL (8)	81	0.00	45.7	6.97	TIER 8	WR	Perriman found himself in the mile long list of Baltimore injuries. He looks to establish himself as the no.1 option for the Ravens with Steve Smith coming off of injury as well. Perriman has the physical tools to be a very interesting WR. Extreme speed (a 4.24 at his pro day) combined with Joe Flacco's arm and Marc Trestman's offense could turn into a high yield fantasy situation. We saw Torrey Smith have some very productive seasons in Baltimore, look for Perriman to provide a great late round value.
Tajae Sharpe TEN (13)	87	0.00	52.83	5	TIER 8	WR	Tajae Sharpe was a leader in the NCAA in receptions and has received a lot of buzz around the Titans camp this offseason. Early reports were that he was running ahead of "budding superstar" Dorial Green-Beckham. At first it was assumed that it was only to motivate DGB. After the first few preseason games however, it seems Sharpe might be the real deal. He appears set to be a starter who is capable of making tough NFL catches.
Malcolm Mitchell NE (9)	90	0.00	48.77	7.5	TIER 8	WR	Malcolm Mitchell is a great route runner with good hands. He couldn't have found a better spot than landing in New England with Tom Brady. After tearing up the field in his first preseason game, he unfortunately tore up his elbow and will be out for a few weeks. The injury along with Brady's suspension means that Mitchell will usually go undrafted, but keep your eye on him as a great prospect.
Davante Adams GB (4)	70	0.00	80.3	7	TIER 9	WR	To quote Jason Moore, "He STINKS!". It's hard to come to any other conclusion after watching Adams last year. To be fair, he wasn't getting true WR1 help from Cobb, and the run game was a disaster with Eddie Lacy. So perhaps he was a victim of circumstance. It won't be surprising to see Green Bay go a different direction with the offense and show Adams to the bench.
Jermaine Kearse SEA (5)	75	0.00	56.17	3.25	TIER 9	WR	Kearse went looking for a contract in free agency, but ended up back with Seattle. The positive: Kearse's numbers have steadily increased each season. The negative: Kearse could see himself behind Tyler Lockett in the pecking order.
Michael Thomas NO (5)	75	11.03	71.43	6.7	TIER 9	WR	Another rookie that hit the jackpot for a landing spot. When you play WR for the Saints, you have to be just awful at your job to have no fantasy value. Brees is still one of the top QBs in the league, and the Saints offense lets him gun it. Thomas will have to beat out Brandon Coleman to have any kind of real playing time this year, but there's a better chance of that happening than not.
Albert Wilson KC (5)	77	0.00	56.47	3	TIER 9	WR	
Victor Cruz NYG (8)	78	13.07	53.33	8.5	TIER 9	WR	Cruz is now a few years removed from his horrifying primetime knee injury. He had said he was going to return last year until a calf injury ended up holding him out for the season. He says he will be ready to go this season, but is still working out on the side of practice. He's an interesting pick if he actually plays, but his return remains to be seen.
Brandon Coleman NO (5)	79	0.00	66.5	6.83	TIER 9	WR	Coleman gained some buzz as a rookie for the Saints, with Graham leaving town and Colston slowing down. Unfortunately, he was only able to put up 450 yards and two touchdowns. He fell clearly behind Willie Snead. Now Coleman has highly drafted rookie Michael Thomas coming into camp to take his spot. What you can't take away from Coleman is his 6'6", 225lb frame.
Danny Amendola NE (9)	80	0.00	65	6.67	TIER 9	WR	The backup to Julian Edelman had a series of very solid games last season. But anyone expecting anything more from Amendola is in for disappointment as that is all he is. Not really worth a roster spot with Edelman healthy, to a must start if Edelman goes down.
Anquan Boldin DET (10)	81	14.01	45.23	3	TIER 9	WR	Old man Boldin is still getting it done again. He has signed with the Detroit Lions and has already played himself into the primary slot receiver for this team. He's looked solid in camp and should be on the field a lot in 2016. The problem is he won't be racking up enough yards or TDs in this role to be a fantasy starter. We'd rather take a riskier pick with more upside.
Eddie Royal CHI (9)	83	0.00	42.83	4.5	TIER 9	WR	Things lined up well for Royal last year. A return to the QB that made him fantasy relevant, and an injury to rookie Kevin White oppened up a lot of possible playing time. Royal was unable to do much with the time he had and then dealt with his own injuries. The magic isn't going ot return for Royal.
Chris Conley KC (5)	83	0.00	42.27	4.5	TIER 9	WR	
Jeff Janis GB (4)	85	0.00	38	7.37	TIER 9	WR	Welp, Janis has broken his hand and simply won't be able to overtake any kind of early season role, much less the WR3 spot for Green Bay. Look to Adams at this point to hold his job.
Jamison Crowder WAS (9)	86	0.00	27.83	2	TIER 9	WR	
Cole Beasley DAL (7)	87	0.00	26.17	4	TIER 9	WR

Rob Gronkowski NE (9)	1	1.12	177.6	4	TIER 1	TE	Gronk has finished as the top TE two years in a row and it wasn't even close. He averages 27 more points than the #2 TE in that span and guarantees you a great point advantage at that position. But in 80 games, he's never played without Tom Brady who will be missing for the first 4 games. He'll cost you a first round pick, which makes the pick a little risky.
Jordan Reed WAS (9)	2	4.06	151.47	6.03	TIER 2	TE	Rule 86 says that if Jordan Reed is playing, he's in your lineup. In a PPR setting last year he actually outpaced Gronk for the games he played. If he can stay on the field, he could be a better draft day value than Gronk as he can be grabbed in the third or fourth. But his injury history is a major concern. In three years he's missed 15 games or almost 1 out of every 3 games.
Greg Olsen CAR (7)	3	5.02	134.87	1.37	TIER 3	TE	Greg Olsen is tried and true. He has back to back 1,000 yard seasons and hasn't missed a game in EIGHT straight seasons. His reliability makes him a plug and play start. He won't finish #1, but he won't finish out of the top 8 either.
Gary Barnidge CLE (13)	3	9.04	132.77	3.83	TIER 3	TE	Maximum Barnidge came out of NOWHERE last year to finish as the 2nd or 3rd best TE depending on your scoring system. While he was better with McCown at the helm, he was still used quite a bit when Manziel took over. Add in the fact that the Browns gave him a hefty contract this offseason and there is all the reason to believe that he can reproduce what he did last year no matter who is under center. Hue Jackson did a great job last year using Tyler Eifert in the redzone and he is bringing his offense with him to the Browns. There just aren't many options for Cleveland, other than throwing the ball his way often, which is something you look for in a fantasy TE.
Travis Kelce KC (5)	5	6.04	127.43	3.63	TIER 3	TE	Zeus was highly touted, highly drafted, and highly disappointed you last year in fantasy football. He didn't finish terrible, but for the capital it took to get him, he didn't return. This year we should see much of what we saw last year from him. He's one of the best Tight Ends in the league and dynamic when he gets used in the passing game. I expect a few more TDs to fall his way this year and he has the best strength of schedule in 2016 for the Tight End position. All of that could make Kelce a draft day steal if you aren't too let down from last season.
Coby Fleener NO (5)	6	6.08	129.83	3.67	TIER 3	TE	The saints utilize the TE better than any team over the last 6 seasons. Last year Benjamin Watson finished as a top TE at the ripe old age of 35. Fleener has size, speed, youth, and route running ability to exceed what Watson did and should be one of the steals of the draft if you can grab him late.
Antonio Gates SD (11)	7	11.01	123.3	5	TIER 4	TE	Gates could be the steal of the position this year. Yes, he's old. Yes, he's broken down. Yes, he's still a dominate weapon for Philip Rivers who is being drafted at the very back of the draft. Ladarius Green is out of town and Hunter Henry is only a rookie who won't make a big impact. Gates is the go to 3rd down guy and utilized well in the red zone. The Chargers also boast the third best schedule for fantasy tight ends this year.
Tyler Eifert CIN (9)	8	7.07	118.9	5.5	TIER 4	TE	This year's TE darling to many people is Eifert. He is a monster in the red zone and provided great value for where he got picked up last year. But there is reason to worry about TD regression given his relatively low reception total. He could certainly finish high, but he'll cost you a high pick to get. He's boom or bust, but you could do worse as he should reel in at least 8 TDs.
Zach Ertz PHI (4)	9	10.1	117.5	5.03	TIER 4	TE	Ertz is a favorite of The Fantasy Footballers. He is a good route runner who should be able to do some special things this year. He took a big step forward in his third season jumping up to 75 receptions and over 850 yards. The problem was TDs. Despite 75 catches, he only had 2 touchdowns. Most of the blame for this should not go his way though as Bradford targeted, and missed, Ertz in the redzone numerous times last year. They started finding their groove late last year and with another year together, if Bradford is the starter, Ertz should have a very good fantasy season.
Delanie Walker TEN (13)	10	7.03	113.43	4.5	TIER 4	TE	Delanie Walker just signed a new contract which is always a good sign for a player being used in the same role. That being said, the Titans want to run the ball more this year with their "exotic smashmouth" offense. When you add in that they will have Kendall Wright healthy, a more experienced DGB, and brought in new passcatcher Rishard Matthews into town we expect Delanie Walker to come down a bit from his career high season last year.
Eric Ebron DET (10)	12	14.03	113.37	4.13	TIER 4	TE	Eric Ebron was the 10th overall pick by the Lions when he came out of college for a reason. By every (non-Gronk) standard, tight ends take a few years to come into their own and Ebron is coming into his third year. Even still, his first two years showed glimpses of what could be to come grabbing five TDs in 2015. With Calvin Johnson now retired, there is a huge red zone hole that needs to be filled. If their top 10 pick is able to step up and fill that void, Ebron could be the steal of the tight end class for 2016
Dwayne Allen IND (10)	11	12.12	113.87	4.83	TIER 5	TE	The last several years there has been an argument as to who is the better tight end to draft from the Colts. Some people preferred the more-involved Coby Fleener and some preferred the better red zone option, Dwayne Allen. Well now Dwayne Allen is both of those. The Colts have promised to have him more involved in the offense and he was already a key part of their red zone when Andrew Luck was in tow.
Julius Thomas JAC (5)	13	8.07	106.8	4.37	TIER 5	TE	Julius Thomas was a forgotten man last year after his injury derailed a third of his season. During that time Blake Bortles found new TD targets in the Allen bros and didn't seem to use him too much in the redzone. With JT, he needs touchdowns. His value in the 2013-2014 seasons came entirely from his heavy touchdown output of 12 per year. He is not a volume receiver, so if you draft him you have to hope he gets more involved in the red zone offense or plan to stream the position.
Jason Witten DAL (7)	14	14.01	101.13	1.5	TIER 6	TE	Last year seems like a down year for Jason Witten, but it really wasn't. Considering that he lost Tony Romo for most of the year and the team's offense was just downright terrible, he still had over 100 targets and came down with 77 balls. The problem was that he only hit pay-dirt 3 times (he averaged 6 touchdowns a year over the previous 5 seasons). He's still as reliable as they come and a huge part of their offense. He should be what he always is, a low end TE1 and he'll cost you nothing at the draft.
Vance McDonald SF (8)	14	0.00	103.67	4.03	TIER 6	TE	Had sneaky fantasy value for a tiny chunk of the season. New coach Chip Kelly has seen some successful TE campaigns emerge. McDonald will likely go undrafted in your leagues, but he's a name to keep in mind for the waivers, or can even be drafted in very deep leagues.
Zach Miller CHI (9)	16	14.02	103.93	5	TIER 6	TE	The other Zach Miller became a solid waiver wire pickup last season when Martellus Bennett went down. The crazy part for Miller is, he played a total of four games from 2011-2014. He wisely went looking for an immediate payday at the end of the season, but wiser than that nobody offered him anything in the range he was looking for. Eventually he agreed to terms with the Bears. Miller is an intriguing guy if you are looking to completely punt the TE position.
Will Tye NYG (8)	17	0.00	96.87	5.03	TIER 6	TE	Tye was an UDFA that fought his way onto the Giants roster. Word from those that cover the team feel Tye will be the starter headed into the season. Tye didn't have numbers to blow you away, but he was involved in the offense and received his fair share of targets. If you stack your team with depth and wait on TE, Tye should be in consideration.
Martellus Bennett NE (9)	18	12.03	92.6	4.7	TIER 7	TE	Martellus Bennett has been a capable fantasy tight end for many years and now goes to the Patriots to take on what people hope is the "Aaron Hernandez role." Call us skeptical. There is a reason the Bears let him walk and you could see it in his last season (when he was actually healthy). He's still only 29 and he is an upgrade over Scott Chandler for sure. But the Patriots have tried to fill the "Aaron Hernandez role" for years with little to no success because, quite frankly, none of those guys are as good as Hernandez was. Bennett isn't either in this stage of his career. Bennett should get a few TDs this year and be used in the passing game to make him an occasional streamer.
Kyle Rudolph MIN (6)	19	0.00	89.27	4	TIER 7	TE	Rudolph came into the league with very high expectations from the fantasy community. Year after year we would continue to hope for the breakout to happen. At this point he is what he is. He can be the occasional fill in help, but he can't be counted on to be a weekly part of your lineup.
Charles Clay BUF (10)	20	0.00	83.97	4.17	TIER 7	TE	Charles Clay was not worth the money that the Bills paid to get him last season, but he might be worth a flier late in your draft. Clay is a talented pass catcher with big play potential. We saw him explode a few times last year in Buffalo, but more often than not he was rather quiet. The problem with relying on Clay is that Buffalo is a team that throws near the bottom in the league making Clay a good streamer but lousy to rely on.
Clive Walford OAK (10)	21	0.00	82.07	5.33	TIER 7	TE	A decent sleeper at the TE spot. QB Derek Carr has shown he will get the ball to the TE. Walford was a rookie last year, but was actually able to make a little bit of noise towards the end of the season. Some are calling for the breakout, while some say he's a terrible football player. It's unlikely to see it happen this year, but Walford is a well rounded player and a breakout wouldn't be a shock.
Jordan Cameron MIA (8)	22	0.00	82.57	5.83	TIER 7	TE	Since Cameron's breakout season a few years ago, he hasn't come anywhere close to matching that type of fantasy output. In fact the last two years combined would still be worse than his big year. The physical tools are all there. Now Adam Gase comes to town, an offensive coach that likes to use the TE (think Julius Thomas and Martellus Bennet). He would only be a flier, but you could fly worse than on Cameron.
Ladarius Green PIT (8)	23	9.09	62.67	4.83	TIER 7	TE	Ladarius Green is now dealing with a very murky situation. It's reported that he is dealing with headaches still from a concussion last season. It's not good. It's hands off at this point and he could even be heading the IR.
Austin Seferian-Jenkins TB (6)	25	0.00	68.33	5.33	TIER 7	TE	ASJ has been a major disappointment to this point in his career. But we need to remember that his "career" has only been two seasons. Over the course of those two seasons, he's missed 16 total games. But great TEs don't usually show up until their third year in the league anyway, and you saw some dynamic plays with ASJ and Winston last year as he averaged 16.1 yards per reception. This is a true boom or bust candidate, but time is running out on him to stake claim to the Bucs primary TE position. However, if he plays a full 16 this year, he has the talent to be top 5 at the position.
Benjamin Watson BAL (8)	24	0.00	78	4.53	TIER 8	TE	We love Benjamin Watson. He's a great dude, with a great story, and we're happy for him to have had the year he had with the Saints last year. Heck, we're even happy he was able to turn that into a new contract with the Ravens. But his fantasy value came from the system and the QB he had last year. At 35 years old, he's going to a team that has a young stud TE in Maxx Williams and serviceable TE "Betty" Crockett Gillmore. He'll be used to block and mentor the young guys, not to produce for fantasy owners. Draft him only as a good luck charm, not a player.
Jared Cook GB (4)	27	13.1	72.17	5.03	TIER 8	TE	Jared Cook is a possible upside candidate this year at tight end now that he's made the move to the Packers. But be careful of your expectations. Aaron Rodgers hasn't used the tight end position very much since the departure of Jermichael Finley. Last year it took injuries to Jordy Nelson and Andrew Quarless PLUS a hail marry touchdown to make Richard Rodgers barely a tight end 1. Then there's the fact that Richard Rodgers is still there to split with Jared Cook.
Maxx Williams BAL (8)	28	0.00	67.43	5	TIER 8	TE	Williams was the first TE taken in his draft class. It didn't pan out for much last year. The Ravens decided to add veteran Ben Watson to their depth chart, making things very unclear for Maxx. He was drafted to be a pass catcher, he's in Marc Trestman's offense that is frequently friendly to the TE. The table is set, but unfortunately there's around 4 plates at that table
Virgil Green DEN (11)	26	0.00	62.4	5.93	TIER 9	TE	An athletic monster that many in the fantasy industry have pleaded to see unleashed. This could be the year. The team has been talking him up. Kubiak has a system that generally involves the TE. More likely a name to watch for the waiver wire
Richard Rodgers GB (4)	29	0.00	45.57	5.03	TIER 9	TE	Managed to swindle his way to being a TE1 last year. Mostly on the heels of touchdowns, and specifically a one legendary hailmary play that will haunt the dreams of Lions fans to eternity. His production was erratic at best. He is still young. But the Packers brought in Jared Cook during the offseason. It would be a shock to see Rodgers do much of anything for fantasy this year.
Jimmy Graham SEA (5)	30	10.04	17.87	9.55	TIER 9	TE	Jimmy Graham was a fantasy all-star tight end for the Saints for several years. Last year, he went to the Seahawks and majorly disappointed before getting injured. Even when healthy he was a boom or bust weekly play which is not much different than your average tight end. What's worse is that when he left the team due to injury, their offense seemed to improve. But that was last year... so how about this year? Much, much worse. He's now coming off a devestating injury that says he probably can't return to form in 2016. Sure, they might say he's looking good but we heard the same thing with Victor Cruz last year and we know how well that worked out.
Vernon Davis WAS (9)	31	0.00	0.00	7.95	TIER 9	TE	The Washington insurance plan if something terrible happens to Jordan Reed and Niles Paul isn't able to fill in.
Larry Donnell NYG (8)	32	0.00	19.03	7.05	TIER 9	TE	Donnell is coming off a very serious neck injury. He often looks like an awkward teenager that is still getting used to his body after a big growth spurt. With the way Will Tye played, Donnell could find himself on the bench.
Zach Miller, FA	33	14.02	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	
Crockett Gillmore BAL (8)	34	0.00	0.00	6	TIER 9	TE	Gillmore has had multiple offseason surgeries. He had a decent year and was a useful spot starter for fantasy. But the Ravens have been proactive adding Ben Watson to the roster if Gillmore can't be ready for Week 1.
Jace Amaro NYJ (11)	35	0.00	0.00	5	TIER 9	TE	
Owen Daniels, FA	36	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Owen Daniels proved last year that he isn't good anymore. Plus he doesn't have a team. That always hurts your fantasy value.
