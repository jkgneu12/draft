Aaron Rodgers GB (8)	1	360.55	1.00	2.09	TIER 1	QB	It was a slow and rocky start for the Cheese Slinger. But as Jordy rounded back into form and Davante Adams stepped up, Rodgers became his regular fantasy force. Aside from being an elite QB, the Packers heavily lean on him in the red zone, throwing an astounding 37 red zone TDs. There’s no reason to see Rodgers as anything but a top-3 fantasy QB.
Tom Brady NE (9)	2	326.06	2.33	3.04	TIER 2	QB	Those that chose to traverse the treacherous path of Narrative Street were rewarded upon Brady’s return from serving his 4-game Deflategate suspension. He came out burning down villages and consuming souls. There were some questions once Gronk went down, could Brady keep up the pace? For the most part, the answer was yes. Brady looks to still be at the top of his game but will be costly in drafts.
Andrew Luck IND (11)	3	327.35	3.67	7.10	TIER 2	QB	Luck bounced back rather nicely from his demoralizing and injury plagued 2015. He wasn’t close to replicating his gaudy ‘14 numbers, but was still very solid as well as consistent. Luck posted 11 weeks as a QB1, while posting sustainable production. If he can get a little more help from his offensive line, and a healthy Moncrief (or Kamar Aiken to chip in), Luck should easily finish as a top-5 fantasy QB. | It's still unknown if he will be ready for training camp as he recovers from shoulder surgery. It's not overly concerning yet, but a situation to watch.
Drew Brees NO (5)	4	323.58	2.83	4.05	TIER 2	QB	Ho hum. Drew Brees adds another 5k passing yard season to his resume, the only qb to do so in ‘16. While the hope for the addition of Coby Fleener never really panned out, 2nd round draft pick Michael Thomas stepped into a prominent role nearly immediately. The home/road splits are a legitimate complaint (a 6 pt difference last year), but he still posted 10 weeks as a QB1, and was top-3 at his position 5 times. Brees is a top-5 lock.
Russell Wilson SEA (6)	5	316.67	3.43	6.12	TIER 3	QB	Watching Wilson’s 2016 season was reminiscent of watching Groundhog Day. High draft price, tons of hype, then came out the gates like a childs cap gun. To be fair, he was playing through some pretty serious ankle injuries, he looked like a half-mummy on Sundays. And behind the Seahawks “offensive line”, even a gazelle would have a tough time not getting sacked. But, once health returned to his legs, and the Baldwin-Wilson connection heated up, he was back to fantasy gold. Wilson had been a QB1 every year he’s been in the league before narrowly missing the threshold last year. Lockett’s availability will be in question, but Paul Richardson filled in nicely. The weapons are there, and the smashmouth days of Marshawn Lynch are long gone.
Matt Ryan ATL (5)	6	303.57	4.33	5.08	TIER 3	QB	Will Ryan get the no.1 fantasy QB bump? Nearly every year, the reigning QB champ earns the prestige of being over drafted as the first QB off the board the following year. That trend could come to an end with Ryan. There are some real concerns with Ryan: a major change in the coaching staff (goodbye KShy), coming off by far the best year of his career (38 TDs - only the 2nd time in his 9 year career over 30), and a Super Bowl hangover. It’s possible Ryan has in fact leveled up and is also surrounded by talent, but it’s no guarantee he continues to melt faces.
Kirk Cousins WAS (5)	7	298.30	3.83	8.04	TIER 3	QB	As of right now, today, Kirk Cousins is still part of the Washington Redskins. Think what you want on the question of, is he a good QB because he’s been a great fantasy QB the last few years. He threw for nearly 5000 yards, his completion percentage is near the top of the league, his TD to INT ratio is 2:1. But, his overall touchdowns were low, lower than last year despite the addition of 800 passing yards. Sure, Cousins lost Garcon and Djax, but he now gets Terrelle Pryor and Josh Doctson, and that Jordan Reed guy is still there. Cousins will once again not get the fantasy respect he deserves and is a great option for those waiting on QB.
Dak Prescott  DAL (6)	8	292.09	5.17	10.08	TIER 3	QB	It did not take the rookie long to prove himself valuable for fantasy purposes. Only 5 QBs posted double digit weeks as a QB1. Rodgers/Luck/Ryan/Brees and Prescott. Granted, he was the only one of these five that didn’t post a top-3 performance, but he was extremely consistent. It took time to get things going with his no.1 WR, but eventually they got on the same page. Dak doesn’t run like people had envisioned, but he’s not shy about running near the goal line, tying with Tyrod Taylor for the most QB rushing TDs with 6. He likely won’t be cheap in drafts, but also not overly expensive.
Cam Newton CAR (11)	9	293.17	5.50	8.08	TIER 3	QB	WELP. Much like Icarus, Cam flew too close to the sun in ‘15. The ultimate late round reward two years ago, and a gargantuan bust for those that paid up in ‘16. He only posted QB1 numbers five times last year. Almost more concerning was the beating he took on a nearly weekly basis. A sub 60% completion passer and now his coach is talking of decreasing his rushing attempts. The rewards can be great with Cam and his draft price should go down considerably. How will the addition of McCaffery and Samuel look? On top of that, Cam has undergone offseason shoulder injury and won’t even begin throwing again until right before training camp.
Marcus Mariota TEN (8)	10	286.57	5.33	8.08	TIER 4	QB	Mariota’s fantasy season is incredibly strange. From Weeks 5-12 he averaged the second-most QB points, behind only Drew Brees. He was beating up on a string of terrible pass defenses. But prior to that in Weeks 3-4, the only starting QB to average fewer points than Mariota was Ryan Fitzpatrick. He finished the year on another horrifyingly bad streak before breaking his fibula. He should be ready to start the season, but his 2017 season production is tough to get a feel for.
Andy Dalton CIN (6)	10	288.45	4.83	11.09	TIER 4	QB	It was a rough year for Andy Dalton. He couldn’t seem to get all his offensive weapons healthy at the same time. He only had four games with Green, Eifert, and Gio healthy at the same time. He still managed seven weeks as a QB1 despite throwing for a career-low 18 TDs. With Green and Eifert seemingly ready to go to start the season, and Tyler Boyd having some experience under his belt, Andy Dalton carries some late round intrigue. It was only a few years ago Dalton was cruising as a stud fantasy QB, and now the team has added speedster John Ross.
Matthew Stafford DET (7)	12	287.32	3.58	10.07	TIER 4	QB	Stafford started the year on a monstrous tear. From Weeks 1-6, Stafford was averaging the 2nd most fantasy ppg for all QBs. That pace was unsustainable, but fantasy owners at least thought they had found a reliable option. Well, the cooldown saw Stafford averaging the 19th most ppg from Weeks 7-13. THEN Stafford dislocated his middle finger on his throwing hand and his season went full tilt. At this point, he is who he is. He’s not a bad option to start the year as he won’t be expensive and won’t be hard to release if he’s not getting the job done.
Ben Roethlisberger PIT (9)	13	283.00	5.17	9.08	TIER 5	QB	It’s been talked to death, but for good reason. The home/road differential is large and real. At home, Ben averaged over 31ppg, on the road….just over 16ppg. Add in a high draft price and the fact he’s played 16 games only three times in his 12-year career, and Ben could be a guy to avoid. If he’s reasonably priced, streaming his away games should be a viable strategy, but then you have to deal with the anguish of benching him 50% of the time. However, the re-addition of Martavis Bryant means those home game explosions have gone nuclear making Ben at least a bit more appealing.
Tyrod Taylor BUF (6)	14	281.00	7.33	12.08	TIER 5	QB	Those who took the late shot of Taylor in drafts likely gave him the boot when he and Bills fell on their faces in Week 1. Those who gave him a pass were treated to the QB6 from Weeks 2-9. The 2nd half of the season was a disaster, as he plummeted to the QB15 during that time. Surprisingly, that 2nd half is when Sammy Watkins actually played. The offseason hasn’t been the best for the Bills, but Taylor will be back, and the combo of his running ability with (maybe?) a healthy Sammy Watkins makes him a fantasy weapon | Tyrod truthers don’t have a reason to panic with the trade of Sammy Watkins. His fantasy output has been nearly identical in games with/without his top WR. Yes his passing numbers go down, but it’s balanced out with a rise in rushing production. If you liked Tyrod before, theres reason to feel the same.
Jameis Winston TB (11)	15	280.90	4.67	7.06	TIER 5	QB	Overall it was a solid year 2nd year for Winston. Over 4000 yards and 28 passing touchdowns and over 60% completion rate. Unfortunately, the jump people were hoping for didn’t quite happen. The Bucs passing game was relegated to Mike Evans and Cameron Brate. Jameis was still making many poor decisions leading to turnovers. But, the team did something about the offensive deficiencies and added deep threat Desean Jackson and Chris Godwin in the draft. At worst, Winston will be in the QB 11-14 range, but he has the talent and passing weapons to perform much better.
Philip Rivers LAC (9)	16	278.87	3.83	9.12	TIER 5	QB	Rivers quietly had a solid fantasy season. He still ended up as a QB1, despite losing his top weapon Keenan Allen at the beginning of the season. What most people remember of Rivers from last year, the interceptions. He had a league-leading 21. So it always felt like while he was putting up good games, he would also hamstring those giant fantasy weeks. With Allen expected back to start the year, the emergence of Tyrell Williams and Hunter Henry, the drafting of Mike Williams, Rivers should keep on trucking as a dependable fantasy QB.
Derek Carr OAK (10)	17	274.37	3.58	6.09	TIER 5	QB	Carr turned in a pretty solid 2016 campaign. Eight weeks as a QB1, six weeks with 3+ TD passes. Yes, he’s coming off of the ankle injury, but it’s hard to not like how things are trending for Carr. He already has one of the better WR pairs in the league, a coach that actually understands game theory and will go for it on 4th down, and now he has a pair of tremendous pass catching RBs in Washington and Richard. Carr is in a great spot to rain down fantasy points in 2017. The downside of Carr is his interdivisional play. He has been truly awful against KC and DEN.
Carson Palmer ARI (8)	18	267.25	5.17	13.01	TIER 6	QB	The expectations were heavy for Carson Palmer. He was coming off of not just a great year, but by far the best year of his career. He only performed as a QB1 six times and saw his passing TDs drop from 35 to 26, while his INTs grew from 11 to 14. A few different factors are involved in the down year. Most notable would be the Houdini act performed by John Brown. Brown dealt with severe leg problems caused by a sickle cell trait and a cyst on his spine. Allegedly Brown now has his health under control. A returning Brown/Fitz, and the addition of 3rd round pick Chad Williams, could see a bounceback for Palmer who is surely to be left for dead by fantasy players.
Eli Manning NYG (8)	19	260.97	6.17	11.05	TIER 6	QB	The wheels seemed to fall off for Eli last year as he posted, by far, his worst year playing under Ben Mcadoo. His numbers went down across the board and he simply looked befuddled frequently. Even the Giants know the end is nearing for their franchise QB. Does Eli have enough left for fantasy in ‘17? It’s extremely hard to buy in. He at least has some lethal pass-catching weapons around him and good pass blocking unit up front. Could it bounce back for Eli? Sure, but drafting Eli is going to feel like blindly sticking your hand into a hole inside a haunted house.
Blake Bortles JAC (8)	20	252.05	8.17	14.03	TIER 6	QB	The ultimate garbage man of 2015 morphed into ultimate garbage for 2016. That’s actually being a bit harsh for a guy who finished yet again as a QB1. He posted six weeks as a QB1, but people are going to remember those other six weeks. Bortles allegedly played through multiple shoulder separations and wrist tendonitis. While seeing his completions rise from ‘15, he also watched his yardage regress and his TDs plummet from 35 to 23. He’s still young and has tremendous pass catching weapons around him. It’s not of the question that Bortles can return to numbers that at least moderately resemble his 2015 campaign.
Carson Wentz PHI (10)	21	245.70	5.17	12.07	TIER 7	QB	Wentz showed some real tangible promise as a rookie. Eventually, defenses caught on, but he wasn’t receiving a ton of help from his weapons. The Eagles knew this and did something about it, signing the most prestigious WR on the market in Alshon Jeffery, and burner Torrey Smith. If Carson fails this year, it’s on him. Whether or not these new weapons can turn Wentz into a weekly starter remains to be seen. It could happen, but he’s not likely an early option for single-QB leagues.
Sam Bradford MIN (9)	22	239.18	4.33	14.08	TIER 7	QB	Bradford hasn’t been able to tack anything onto his personal accolades since being drafted no.1 in 2010…..UNTIL NOW! Bradford posted the highest single-season completion percentage of all time. Did that translate to fantasy production? For the most part no. But to be fair, Sammy Biscuits was traded literally right before the season started, even missing the Vikings first game. The team has legit weapons in Diggs, Thielen, and Rudolph. He’s a great streaming option and has a (small, oh so small) chance to be a low-end QB1.
Jay Cutler MIA (11)	23	233.17	5.33	14.06	TIER 8	QB	Smoking Jay Cutty is back after the sad news of Ryan Tannehill's torn ACL. He reunites with Adam Gase in Miami with one of the best supporting casts of receiving options he has ever had. While this gun slinger has finished as a top 12 fantasy QB two times, it has also been 8 years since he has made it through a full 16 game season. His presense will help ensure that the running game can stay strong and his arm strength could bump up the downfield threats of Parker and Stills. He should be a good value in 2QB leagues.
Joe Flacco BAL (10)	24	235.83	3.50	14.05	TIER 8	QB	Did you know Joe Flacco only had one fewer passing attempt than Drew Brees? It’s now been back to back years where the Ravens have let the ball fly and put the offense on Flacco’s back. Flacco though seems to break the mantra of opportunity is king in fantasy football. Despite his tremendous passing volume, he was the QB20 due to low TDs. He’s almost always in streaming consideration because he’s almost always on the waiver wire. But Joe isn’t likely to become a QB1 at this point of his career.
Trevor Siemian DEN (5)	25	226.10	7.00	0.00	TIER 8	QB	Siemian was a pleasant surprise last year. Most would have scoffed at a 7th round draft pick starting for a potential Super Bowl team. But, there was Siemian, and he played respectably. He even had 3 weeks as QB1, including a week as the no.1 QB of the week. Before his injury in the last quarter of the season, Siemian looked like things might be starting to click. It was visible during his last games he was in pain, and he underwent shoulder surgery in the offseason. At this point, he should be the starter Week 1, but he will be in constant threat of losing his job and isn’t more than a streaming option.
Brian Hoyer SF (11)	26	213.55	6.17	0.00	TIER 8	QB	Brian Hoyer has been excellent for fantasy lately. He was a dream-stream during his time in Houston, and last year with Chicago, in his 4 full starts he wasn’t once under 300 yards and threw 6 touchdowns with 0 interceptions. He now joins forces with offensive guru Kyle Shanahan in SF. Sure, the roster isn’t ideal, but Hoyer has already known the system from their time together in Cleveland. Garcon lead the league in receptions the last time he played with Shanahan. Hoyer is going to be left for dead on draft day, and for those that look at him logically, it won’t be shocking if at the end of the year Hoyer is a low-end QB1.
Alex Smith KC (10)	27	214.00	2.50	14.06	TIER 8	QB	The Ultimate Game Manager Alex Smith. He’s always available to stream in a pinch, and can often come through. He only threw for 15 TDs, but he came through with 5 rushing TDs, to hit his normal quota of right around 20 total touchdowns. Unfortunately, the Blandman left his spices at home and his regular rushing production vanished. At this point, he is who he is. The right matchup should get you a start worthy game from Smith, but he’ll never be an every week guy.
Josh McCown NYJ (11)	28	205.44	8.50	0.00	TIER 9	QB	McCown is the Energizer Bunny version of a QB. The man has been absolutely annihilated on the football field the last few years. His spirit and courage are admirable, but it’s also lead to minimal playtime. He’s never played a full 16 games in his 14-year career, in fact, he’s played double-digit games just twice. He has Powell out the backfield but receiving options are rough, especially with word that Quincy Enunwa is done for the season.. There is little doubt that McCown will put up some fantasy numbers and be a great streamer, but how many weeks can he hold up this time?
Jared Goff LAR (8)	29	188.09	6.33	0.00	TIER 9	QB	When a team mortgages their future for a franchise QB who can’t manage to overtake an undrafted journeyman but eventually is begrudgingly started Week 11, coaches get fired. Frankly, that’s possibly the best outcome of a lost rookie season for Goff. Now Sean McVay takes over the team and brings a pretty successful offensive scheme with him. The Rams have made some improvements to the o-line and brought in Robert Woods to be the WR2 (or 1?). It’s pretty easy to write Goff off (HA!), but perhaps McVay’s West Coast offense will jumpstart his career | The Rams made a surprise trade for Sammy Watkins. It should be a huge upgrade for the Rams passing offense and Goff. However, Goff will have to drastically improve from last year if he’s going to take advantage of his new offensive weapon.
Mike Glennon CHI (9)	30	195.23	7.33	0.00	TIER 9	QB	Glennon started this offseason like the belle of the ball. He got a nice sized contract from the Bears, especially considering he has little starting experience and has been a backup the past few years. And then the draft happened, with the Bears moving up to take Mitch Trubisky. Glennon will likely play most of if not all of 2017. With the right matchup, he has the weapons in Meredith/White/Miller to make some things happen. It’s Jordan Howard’s team, so the team is unlikely to lean on Glennon.
Deshaun Watson HOU (7)	31	155.65	6.67	14.07	TIER 9	QB	It’s not a given that Watson will be the starter for the Texans right away, but with the assets, the team gave up to move up and draft him combined with his competition is Tom Savage, it’s highly likely we see Watson under center Week 1. He’s coming into an excellent situation. It’s a run first/defense oriented team. But when called upon to throw he has options like Deandre Hopkins and Will Fuller (now expected to miss at least the first 4 weeks). If Watson is as good as the Texans believe he is, he could be a low-end QB1 sooner than later. But, he’s a wait and see, no need to draft him.
Cody Kessler CLE (9)	32	139.89	8.00	0.00	TIER 9	QB	Kessler should be the starter for Cleveland to begin the season. But he has 2nd round draft pick, Deshone Kizer, breathing down his back. Kessler wasn’t a train wreck last year, he had a couple decent games, even posting a fantasy QB1 week. Kessler is going to have to make a big impression quickly just to hold onto his job. He’s not worth anything more than a stash in 2QB leagues.
Tom Savage HOU (7)	33	41.57	9.00	0.00	TIER 9	QB	He’s likely to be beat out by Deshaun Watson. But in the event he becomes the starter for Houston, he’s still likely nothing more than a low-end streaming option.
David Johnson ARI (8)	1	286.07	2.67	1.01	TIER 1	RB	Remember when DJ was considered a bit of a risky 1st round pick? He blew away all expectations with a line of 293/1239/16. He also added in WR2 numbers with 80/879/4 receiving. It was a monster year that ended in near disaster when DJ went down in a crumbling heap, with what looked like a devastating injury in a meaningless game. That injury was the only thing that prevented DJ from having 100+ yards from scrimmage in every game. Luckily, the injury was minor he will be ready to go this year. He is a consensus top 3 overall pick with no reason to doubt another dominant season.
Le'Veon Bell PIT (9)	2	272.93	5.00	1.02	TIER 1	RB	Bell came out his suspension like a man powered by plutonium. He finished with more rushing yards than David Johnson, and almost as many receptions. He put a cherry on top with a legendary game in the fantasy playoffs posting 236/3 and 4/62 against the Bills. Bell did undergo surgery to repair a core muscle injury, but he should be full-go long before preseason. If he plays all 16 games, Bell will be a steal even at the 1.01, but Bell carries not only injury risk but suspension risk.
LeSean McCoy BUF (6)	3	219.97	4.50	1.05	TIER 2	RB	Hope you enjoyed Shady’s draft discount last year. People were quick to forget how dynamic he can be, and how dominant for fantasy he can be. Sure, he dealt with Gillislee stealing some TDs here and there. But, despite a new coaching staff things are looking great for McCoy in ‘17. This includes adding FB Patrick DiMarco, one of the best run-blocking FBs in the game. There’s no reason to see McCoy slowing down yet, and Gilly has left for the Patriots. Of course, the team could use Johnathan Williams in that poaching role, but that remains to be seen.
Devonta Freeman ATL (5)	4	208.37	3.83	1.07	TIER 2	RB	It’s official. Freeman is good. Very very good. However, for an RB that’s going to very early in fantasy drafts, there are some variables from this offseason. Tevin Coleman proved himself to be a great option for the team, in all aspects of the game similar to Freeman. Offensive guru Kyle Shanahan is now gone. There’s no doubt that Freeman will be productive for fantasy, but will he be productive enough for his draft price?
DeMarco Murray TEN (8)	5	198.58	4.83	1.12	TIER 2	RB	The veteran bounced back in a huge way last year. He finished 3rd in the league in rushing and 7th in running back receptions. His down year in Philly plus the surprise addition of Derrick Henry caused many players to avoid Murray. But, he showed in the correct scheme he’s still got some juice left. It’s very possible that Henry becomes even more involved this year, especially at the goal line, but Murray is a tremendous all-around back and should still see the majority of the RB touches for Tennessee.
Jay Ajayi MIA (11)	6	194.43	5.17	2.02	TIER 2	RB	Ajayi’s 2016 season might as well become a made-for-TV movie. The odds were stacked against him. The team didn’t believe in him and brought in old man Arian Foster who was coming off an achilles injury. Ajayi was left at home for an early away game. The team drafted a running back early, Kenyan Drake. The coach had nothing positive to say about poor Jay. When he finally got the chance, he posted back-to-back 200+ yard games. He followed up those performances with another 200+ game later in the season. It’s not all roses, as after becoming the starter he essentially went ham, ...or averaged 53 yards. You can’t take away his monster games, but he will be a polarizing figure.
Melvin Gordon LAC (9)	6	196.03	5.67	1.08	TIER 2	RB	Gordon found himself in a fantasy nirvana in ‘16. All the other useful RBs on the team went down with injury, leaving Gordon nearly all the work on a solid offense. Of RBs in the top-14 in terms of rushing attempts, only Todd Gurley and Melvin Gordon did not surpass 1000 yards. But, Gordon kept finding his way into the endzone, keeping fantasy players very happy. Gordon gets a perceived upgrade with the hiring of Anthony Lynn, a coach with a pedigree of success for RBs. But, big questions on Gordon’s efficiency and ability to stay healthy need to be asked.
Jordan Howard CHI (9)	8	194.60	5.67	2.01	TIER 2	RB	Jordan Howard went from a 5th round pick in the NFL draft to a waiver wire sensation for fantasy football. Once Jeremy Langford’s inefficiency and injuries paved the way, Howard took the Bears starting job and smashed faces. Despite not starting the first two games, Howard was 2nd in the league in rushing behind only Zeke Elliott. That also included two terrifyingly bad games by Howard, which caused many fantasy players to abandon ship. He will be up against it in his 2nd year. A new QB, an overall bad team, and a high fantasy draft price makes Howard a high risk/reward player.
Marshawn Lynch OAK (10)	9	175.15	6.50	2.10	TIER 3	RB	Not sure if you’ve heard the news yet...but Beast Mode is back! The situation is outstanding for the veteran. He’s the primary ball carrier for a great offense with a great offensive line. Latavius Murray is not the level of player Marshawn is, and even he racked up 12 TDs last year. There are, however, real and fair questions about Lynch. He’s 31, the last time he played was an injury filled season where he was also inefficient. He was frequently giving fantasy owners heart palpitations with his playing status due to a chronic back problem. Can he hold up for a whole year? If yes, he will be a, well, beast. But there is risk involved in drafting him as he rises up the ADP.
Ezekiel Elliott DAL (6)	10	164.42	7.00	2.03	TIER 3	RB	Fantasy football players lost their minds when Zeke was taken 4th overall by the Cowboys. That hype turned Elliott into a 1st round pick, despite never playing a single game as a pro. Sometimes the narrative turns into a fairy tale as Zeke lead the league in rushing by over 300 yards. After a Week 1 bust scare, he consistently put up monster numbers. This year's draft is widely viewed as a three-headed monster at the top between Zeke/DJ/Bell. The Cowboys offensive line has taken some hits this offseason, but Zeke should be good to go | After a month or so of rumors, the NFL has handed Zeke a 6 game suspension. It’s still possible that the suspension is lowered, but the fact is he’s going to miss a lot of time. As of right now, he won’t see the field until Week 8 of the season. It will be hard to spend a high pick, as some aggressive fantasy players will surely do, and stash him for that length of time.
Todd Gurley LAR (8)	10	174.92	6.50	2.05	TIER 3	RB	At large, Todd Gurley was considered a mega-bust for fantasy football. He was often viewed as the overall no.1 RB, but finished as the RB17. And it’s not from a lack of usage either. Only four RBs touched the ball more than Gurley. Those four players all finished in the top-5 for fantasy RBs. There is hope! The team has mercifully released Jeff Fisher and brought in Sean McVay, who had OC’d Washington to a top-12 scoring team the past two years. The team has spent some FA money improving the offensive line. Someone in your draft will likely be willing to reach for him making him a high risk/reward, plant your flag type of player.
Leonard Fournette JAC (8)	12	164.70	4.33	2.06	TIER 3	RB	Boom. Another RB drafted in the top-5. Maybe a bad NFL move, but great for fantasy football! The situation with Fournette is great, on one hand, as he will immediately become the bell cow. The bad part, it’s still the Jaguars. While the team seems to improve on paper every year, we haven’t seen any consistent performances from the team. Yeldon could very well be the passing downs back, and that would spell trouble for Fournette with the team likely playing from behind frequently. He’s going to be a high round fantasy pick, but he oozes with massive potential.
Isaiah Crowell CLE (9)	13	169.59	4.67	3.01	TIER 3	RB	CAAAWWW!! Crowell had a bit of a breakout season ending up as the RB14. It wasn’t the most consistent year, he had more than a few complete clunkers for fantasy. However, Hue Jackson proved once again he can get a strong running game from nearly any crew. The Browns, who have also upgraded their o-line through FA, averaged 2.05 yards before contact (that was top-4). Crowell also became heavily used in the passing game, finishing with 40 receptions. He’s going to become a trendy early/mid round pick but appears to be set up for another good year.
Lamar Miller HOU (7)	14	156.67	4.17	3.02	TIER 3	RB	It appeared like a match made in heaven as the #FreeMiller truthers finally got their wish. Despite over 1000 yards on the ground, Miller only finished as RB18. Granted he essentially missed 3 games, but for a guy with 268 carries to only rush for five TDs is a pretty big let down. O’Brian mentioned easing his carry total a bit and the team added a bruiser in D’Onta Foreman (who could face a suspension). But the offense has to be better than last year….has to be right?
Spencer Ware KC (10)	15	146.83	5.33	4.05	TIER 4	RB	Ware ended up being an incredible draft day value, with Charles essentially missing the whole season, yet somehow felt disappointing. His three rushing touchdowns screams for positive regression for next year. Charles is gone. West isn’t a starting level running back. Ware should be in line for another solid workload. However, the team traded up for Kareem Hunt and the rookie is already generating buzz in KC.
Carlos Hyde SF (11)	16	146.80	7.77	3.11	TIER 4	RB	The lone bright spot for the 49ers last year. Despite being up against the odds, Hyde finished with a respectable 4.6 YPC. Despite carrying the ball 60 times less than Gurley, he out-rushed him by over 100 yards. Now Kyle Shanahan comes to town, which has seen some solid success for runners in the last 5 years. Hyde remains elusive, averaging 5.5 evaded tackles per game. It could still be tough on Hyde with a lack of elite weapons on the team, but he has a history of success on bad teams. The question on Hyde is can he stay healthy, as he only averages 11 games played a year. Equally as concerning, the team has loaded up depth behind Hyde, including Kyle Shanahan's hand-picked 4th round pick Joe Williams.
Mike Gillislee NE (9)	17	146.85	6.17	4.10	TIER 4	RB	It’s good to be Mike Gillislee these days. He was one of the most efficient RBs in the league last year behind LeSean McCoy. The Bills tried to play hardball with an embarrassing original-round tender contract extension. Lucky for Gilly, the Patriots called the Bills bluff and stole him away. It’s not clear yet who will have what role for the Pats, but Gilly seems the most obvious to be the primary grinder, clock-killer, and goal line back. If that’s the case, he would be very valuable considering Blount had 18 TDs last year. The ADP is going to be a risk, but massive reward if he hits.
Dalvin Cook MIN (9)	18	144.50	5.67	3.07	TIER 4	RB	Rewind to last December and Dalvin Cook was in consideration by the dynasty community as the 1.01 (the first pick in rookie drafts). It’s a prestigious honor. Move forward in time to the combine, and Cook absolutely eviscerated his draft stock. Bombing hard on all athletic measurement tests was not something anyone could have expected. Cook is unbelievable on film, fast, shifty, tremendous agility, and burst. His landing spot was not ideal. The Vikings had already invested $5 million into Latavius Murray. The o-line is a hot mess. Jerick McKinnon is still around. Cook could take the main role, but it’s also possible for him to languish on the wrong side of a timeshare for the near future.
C.J. Anderson DEN (5)	19	138.99	6.83	5.01	TIER 4	RB	It’s not often you see a player gain value while injured. But, that’s what appeared to happen when Anderson went out for the year. His backup, Devontae Booker, was extremely inefficient when handed the starting role. The Broncos could not get a consistent run game going after Anderson was out. The team has upgraded their o-line with Ron Leary, a 1st round pick on a tackle, and Anderson is primed to be the focal point of the running attack. His ADP will be interesting to watch if people are willing to jump on, yet again, with Anderson. The addition of Jamaal Charles needs to be monitored as he could siphon away from Anderson if he’s finally healthy.
Christian McCaffrey CAR (11)	19	139.82	4.83	3.05	TIER 4	RB	It seemed like a square going into a round hole with the Panthers drafting CMC. Cam has not been known for his touch passes to the RB position, but here we are. The draft capital infers the team is going to utilize him early and often. Not only is CMC likely the best RB on the team, he’s possibly the best WR on the team. He could easily see time in the slot, will be a matchup nightmare if the Panthers want to stick with the read-option. The possibilities are wide open with CMC’s versatility.
Frank Gore IND (11)	21	140.48	4.17	7.03	TIER 4	RB	Yes, he’s old. Yes, he’s the active touch leader for RBs. But he’s probably going to end up as RB12 because that’s just how Frank Gore does it. It’s not always pretty, it often feels like he’s let you down. But when the year closes, there he is, RB12. People are likely to let him plummet in ADP. He’s a great late round RB target. Nobody’s getting in his way, not Bob Turbin, not rookie Marlon Mack. Gore is going to give everything he’s got into what should be his last year.
Mark Ingram NO (5)	22	137.89	6.50	5.09	TIER 5	RB	Ingram was not the easiest player to own last year. He would have dominant games followed up by multiple weeks of Sean Payton insisting on giving Tim Hightower the bulk of the carries. He still ended up as top-10 RB and was no.14 in total touches. But now the team has added Adrian Peterson and moved up in the 3rd round to draft perceived reception specialist Alvin Kamara. Ingram remains incredibly productive when he gets opportunities and hopefully, his coach will stop harming the team and feature Ingram.
Doug Martin TB (11)	23	134.02	8.00	5.03	TIER 5	RB	Just when you think it’s safe to draft Doug Martin again, another major letdown. Not only was his season a complete disaster with his injury and incredibly bad inefficiency (getting outperformed by Jacquizz Rodgers), but he ended the season with a surprise last minute healthy scratch that turned into a 4-game suspension. He already served one of those games last year for Week 17, but he still starts the year by missing three games. The suspension voided all remaining guaranteed money on his contract, so the team can cut him at any moment with no repercussions. The team has been going out of their way to talk Martin up, so perhaps last year is just an outlier..that joins his other 2 horrific seasons. Still, it’s a great offense that does love to run the ball, so if you can handle his ADP/burning a bench spot, he could be a great value.
Robert Kelley WAS (5)	24	135.53	5.83	7.04	TIER 5	RB	It looked like Kelley was going to come out of the draft unscathed and keep a lock on his starting job for Washington. BUT, then the team drafted an upgraded version of Fat Rob in Samaje Perine. This will be a camp battle to watch as Perine can do everything Kelley can do, but Perine has better hands. Kelley is likely to see his ADP plummet but could be a nice guy to take and ride out for the first few weeks of the season.
Tevin Coleman ATL (5)	25	133.73	4.50	7.02	TIER 5	RB	Tevin Cooollleeeemaaaannn!! Coleman quickly turned himself from a late-round handcuff stash to a useable weekly flex play. The Falcons were such a potent offense they managed to give fantasy value to two RBs. His eight rushing touchdowns may not be replicated next year, but he should come close. There’s also the chance he takes even more work away from Freeman (last year he averaged just under a 43% snap count per game). There’s a high probability he gets over drafted this year, but he’s a rarity that he can be used every week and has RB1 potential if something happens to Devonta Freeman.
Ameer Abdullah DET (7)	26	136.73	6.50	5.08	TIER 5	RB	It’s been a tough start to Abdullah’s career. Incredibly talented, but he was not consistent his rookie year and lost last year to a foot injury. It was a small sample last year, but in Weeks 1-2 Abdullah was clearly the lead back. The Lions did not address the RB position, and the team has verbally backed Abdullah as the starter coming into 2017. There’s a chance for him to be a mid-round stud. Many will not forgive him for the fantasy-burns he has induced, but he looks worth the risk.
Terrance West BAL (10)	26	135.83	4.67	7.10	TIER 5	RB	West appears to have joined the wide list of players the Browns threw away, only to see another team get solid production from. Almost 200 carries and 30+ receptions made him a very useable asset. With the news that Kenneth Dixon will miss all of 2017, West is the projected starter. Yes, Woodhead is around to take some passing work, but try to find a starting RB at a later ADP than West. People still buy the narrative that he stinks. Maybe he does, but it doesn’t matter. Opportunity is king!
Joe Mixon CIN (6)	26	133.84	6.67	3.12	TIER 5	RB	The Bengals clearly thought Mixon was worth a 2nd round pick despite his off-field transgressions. There are legitimate arguments to be made that he’s the most complete RB in the 2017 draft class. For fantasy though, it could be an uphill battle. Marvin Lewis has shown on several occasions a reluctance to play rookies. From Gio to Hill to Boyd and others. However, Gio is returning from a torn ACL and his comeback is unknown at this time. Hill has been close to a disaster since a great rookie season. Once Mixon takes over, he could be looking a full time 3-down role, very rare in the NFL. But that remains a ‘once he takes over’.
Bilal Powell NYJ (11)	29	132.41	4.33	6.06	TIER 5	RB	BLOW PLOW was a monster to end the year in 2016. We’re talking RB3 in points per game over the last 4 weeks. Now the whispers in the bushes are saying Powell could be the starting RB entering the year. He’s never been given a fair shot to be the main guy for an entire year, but everytime he gets the opportunity he delivers. It’s very possible he doesn’t get the opportunity because coaches think he’s likely to breakdown. Powell is a candidate to enjoy a few big games from, then trade at his peak value.
Ty Montgomery GB (8)	30	136.17	5.27	3.12	TIER 5	RB	Monty will be a highly divisive fantasy asset this season. The team did select Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones in the 4th/5th rounds. However, they have officially changed Monty’s position and he is set to be the starter. The split is most likely to be Montgomery and Williams as Jones is still a bit of a raw prospect. Monty was incredibly elusive last year and posted an amazing 5.9 YPC. He’s in a tremendous offense and has a bright future. Assuming he’s able to hold onto the job of course.
Adrian Peterson NO (5)	31	129.94	7.00	4.11	TIER 5	RB	In what certainly felt like an eternity for AP, he was finally signed by the Saints this offseason. It’s a bizarre situation with AP/Ingram/Kamara rounding out another hydra-like RB committee. However, the Saints have done this before and managed to give us three fantasy-relevant guys. Without injury to those around him, AP won’t see enough work to make him a stud RB1. This is also assuming AP still has juice left, which can be debated. He’s old, has the 3rd most touches of active RBs, is coming off an injury, but at least he landed with a high powered offense.
LeGarrette Blount PHI (10)	32	127.31	5.00	5.04	TIER 6	RB	Blount is a very unfortunate victim of circumstance. He’s coming off a season with over 1100 rushing yards and 18 TDs. The Patriots only wanted him back for the minimum. He was in free agent purgatory, but eventually, he landed with the Eagles. And that was as close to as good as it could get for Blount. They have moved on from Ryan Mathews and needed a big back. Mathews got a ton of goal line work, and Blount can be expected to inherit that role. He will be TD-reliant, but he should be a nice RB value in the middle rounds.
Danny Woodhead BAL (10)	32	128.05	5.50	7.08	TIER 6	RB	Woodhead signed a new offseason deal with the Baltimore Ravens. That contract looks like a nice commitment to fully utilizing his skillset. A few things line up tremendously in Woody’s favor. Only Drew Brees threw the ball more than Joe Flacco, and 142 of Flacco’s targets went to a running back. The team tied for 2nd with 107 running back receptions. Toss in that Kenneth Dixon will miss the entire 2017 and Woodhead could once again be a later round RB value.
Matt Forte NYJ (11)	34	121.95	6.00	10.10	TIER 6	RB	Forte had a bizarre year. He looked like a strong RB1 through the first three games, then he was terrible for four games, then he was a stud again for the next four games, before sputtering to the finish line after sustaining an injury. The bad news is, in a lot of the games where Forte was fantasy relevant, he wasn’t all that efficient. Both of his 100-yard games took 30 carries to get there. Bilal Powell came in to close the season and looked dominant. Forte will be a Jet this year, but his time as a featured back has likely come to a close.
Paul Perkins NYG (8)	35	124.00	4.83	6.04	TIER 6	RB	Things certainly could’ve been worse for Perkins coming out of the draft. The Giants looked like a team primed to take one of the better RBs in the draft but didn’t. The team did use a late 4th round pick on Wayne Gallman. Gallman could absolutely usurp Perkins as the oomph/goalline back, but McAdoo is currently endorsing Perkins as the starter. Either way, it could be tough for Perkins to have impactful games with a boatload of pass-catching RBs on the team and a poor run blocking offensive line.
Eddie Lacy SEA (6)	36	119.03	5.67	7.02	TIER 6	RB	Lacy has found himself a new home. The Seahawks have given him a decent sized contract. While he’s allegedly overweight, he wasn’t very thin last year and he was more productive than people remember. Seattle’s o-line was horrendous last year, but when Lacy has momentum he’s very tough to bring down. He will likely cede 3rd down work to CJ Prosise, and if he’s not ready to go he could lose more work than that with Thomas Rawls lurking in the shadows.
Jonathan Stewart CAR (11)	37	118.07	5.50	9.02	TIER 7	RB	Johnny has company for the first time in a long time! The Panthers used their first pick in the draft on running back Christian McCaffrey. Then they used their next pick on hybrid WR/RB Curtis Samuel. There appears to be a major shakeup coming for the Carolina offense. It’s not yet known where Stewart fits into things. A team doesn’t take an RB that early to not give him touches. Stewart did have 9 rushing TDs last year... but that’s also the equivalent of his previous 2 years combined, so there’s no guarantee he keeps that role. Stewart has the look of serious boom/bust production coming in 2017 but he’s available very late in drafts.
Theo Riddick DET (7)	38	113.34	4.67	10.12	TIER 7	RB	Riddick is a great NFL player. He is one of the best pass-catching backs in the league. It was a pretty solid fantasy year for him before the injury, but don’t overlook the absence of Abdullah. Riddick can absolutely put up great PPR numbers, he was tied for a league-leading 5 RB receiving touchdowns, and he only played 10 games. His numbers are skewed in a positive direction based on a workload he’s unlikely to get this year. The good news is Riddick, like Woodhead, seems to drop too far in drafts every year so he still presents good value.
Latavius Murray MIN (9)	39	112.83	5.33	10.06	TIER 7	RB	Murray’s time with the Raiders has come to pass. He leaves behind a potent offense with a stout offensive line, to a mediocre offense with an abysmal offensive line. But, while the situation change is pretty bleak...the Vikings made it much worse in the draft by moving up to take Dalvin Cook. It’s not the time to completely bail on Murray. In fact, there was a Murray last year most fantasy players bailed on because the team drafted Derrick Henry. Money talks and talks loudly. They gave Latavius around 5 million for this year. It could be gross, like Matt Asiata gross, but don’t completely right off Latavius leading the Vikings RB crew in touches.
Jeremy Hill CIN (6)	40	110.22	6.33	10.05	TIER 7	RB	The offseason hasn’t been kind to Jeremy Hill. First, there were reports that he’s going to be demoted leaking from Cincinnati. And that means losing a job to Gio Bernard, who’s recovering from an ACL injury. He’s coming into a contract year without a sniff of getting an extension. Then the trade rumors started to whirl. THEN the team drafted RB Joe Mixon in the 2nd round. Marvin Lewis has a history of sticking with inefficient players over rookies, see Green-Ellis vs Gio in his rookie year, but one thing is clear: The Bengals are ready to be done with Jeremy Hill.
Darren McFadden DAL (6)	41	107.80	5.00	7.12	TIER 7	RB	A very high-level handcuff for Ezekiel Elliott. The team stayed with him through his injury last year. The moment he was ready to play, he was the primary backup for Dallas. Now with the strong possibility of a Zeke suspenson, McFadden will shoot up draft boards | Time to fire up DMC. With Ezekiel Elliott slotted to miss 6 games, DMC becomes a high level play for the early part of the season. When he was the starter two years ago, he rushed for over 1000 yards. The Cowboys will have no choice but to lean on the veteran.
Kareem Hunt KC (10)	42	108.02	5.33	8.03	TIER 7	RB	The Chiefs made an aggressive trade during the draft to move up and get Kareem Hunt, especially considering they had already made a splash trade to move up for Patrick Mahomes. Spencer Ware is still in town and is a solid running back. But Hunt appears to be Andy Reid’s next anointed RB, which means fantasy players must take note. Hunt can operate as a 3-down back, and we’ve seen Reid work magic for fantasy. This is a camp battle to watch, and while Hunt shouldn’t be expected to take the role from Ware immediately, it could happen at some point during the season.
Derrick Henry TEN (8)	43	107.70	3.67	6.06	TIER 8	RB	Henry seemed a strange pick for the Titans when he was drafted in the 2nd round last year. His usage last year was very disappointing for those that paid up in drafts. Murray remained the workhorse for the Titans and looks to repeat that role. However, despite Henry’s fluctuating touch totals, his red zone and 10-zone numbers saw a major uptick starting in Week 8. Weeks 1-7, he saw 1 carry inside the 20. From Week 8 on, he accumulated 23 red zone touches. Notably, the final quarter of the season he was getting a few carries inside the 10. It is possible the team was prepping him for this year to get more goal line attempts. He also carries massive handcuff value.
C.J. Prosise SEA (6)	44	107.21	6.50	11.04	TIER 8	RB	Prosise’s season was not unlike a magician’s flash paper. Fragile, highly combustible, but the explosion is over in an instant. He dealt with injuries in college, he dealt with injuries in training camp, and he was injured in Week 1 and missed 4 games. He finally had an opportunity in mid-November and had a monster game against the Patriots with 152 total yards. The following week he started the game with a 72-yard TD run….before breaking his scapula and missing the rest of the season. He’s likely relegated to the passing downs guy after the team signed Eddie Lacy. But, if Lacy/Rawls can’t stay on the field, Prosise could be amazing, that is if he himself can stay on the field.
Giovani Bernard CIN (6)	45	97.09	5.17	13.12	TIER 8	RB	Gio tore his ACL in late November against the Bills. It was a very strange injury as nobody even realized he was seriously hurt. He left the game, then a few days later the news came as a shocker. His full timeline isn’t known as of now. Beat reporters believe he can avoid the PUP and possibly only miss a few games. He needs to be back quickly before Mixon can establish himself as the pass catching RB of the future.
Duke Johnson CLE (9)	46	96.85	4.00	11.06	TIER 8	RB	The Duke Johnson truthers had a field day this offseason. Sure, things looked like they could break his way. His rushing efficiency went way up, he did have the same amount of targets as last year. But something happened that was not expected. Crowell became heavily utilized in the passing game. The Crow had only 20 fewer targets than Duke. Duke is still a solid PPR type player, and he could drop in drafts after burning the hype last year. He was 6th in RB receptions and 4th in RB receiving yards.
Darren Sproles PHI (10)	47	96.65	3.33	14.03	TIER 8	RB	The swan song for an outstanding RB. Sproles is one of those outlier players, where everything points to him never making in the league. But, he’s going to get you 80+ carries and 50+ receptions. Don’t let the perception, “well he’s not going to be what he was in New Orleans years ago”, take away that Sproles can still have monster games. Relying on him weekly is not an ideal situation, but it’s hard to find a better depth piece that can be plugged in any given week.
Samaje Perine WAS (5)	47	95.14	5.67	9.10	TIER 8	RB	The #PAINBOT landed in a nearly ideal location in Washington. The team has Rob Kelley as the 2-down/goal line back, but Perine is simply a better talent. Washington is a high-scoring offense, and the TD opportunities will be ripe for Perine if he’s able to grab the starter job. The reports out of Washington have that as an immediate possibility. The hype machine could push him into dangerous ADP territory, but if he stays behind the 5th round, go get him.
Thomas Rawls SEA (6)	49	93.40	6.83	8.03	TIER 8	RB	The Seahawks backfield is shaping up to be one to avoid this season. While Rawls has received first-team work over Eddie Lacy in training camp and the first preseason game, he's now dealing with an ankle injury. He's dealt with plenty of injuries over his early NFL career. While he managed a few solid outings last year, Rawls simply couldn’t stay on the field. The injuries were certainly not his fault, but the NFL doesn’t care and it moves on. If you want to grasp onto hope, neither Lacy nor CJ Prosise has been able to stay healthy either, so Rawls may be the lead back (if healthy).
Rex Burkhead NE (9)	50	92.30	5.67	12.12	TIER 8	RB	What a glorious moment it was for the GoatHead truthers! But, it was a fleeting moment. Almost immediately after the signing by the Patriots, the team also extended James White and poached Mike Gillislee from the Bills. Burkhead has talent but his role with New England is a complete unknown at this point.
Jamaal Williams GB (8)	51	87.83	5.00	9.07	TIER 8	RB	It was pretty obvious the Packers had to add someone. And they got a great all-around back in Williams. Montgomery should enter camp with the lead job and some leeway to hold the position. But, if given a shot Williams could excel in the Packers system. Granted, even the lead back for the Packers isn’t likely to get 15+ carries a game.
Jamaal Charles DEN (5)	52	86.93	8.33	10.03	TIER 8	RB	It’s been a rough go lately for Jamaal. He went down in 2015 with an ACL tear and only appeared in three games in 2016. Then the man, who had never rushed for less than 5.0YPC until last year, was cut by the Chiefs. Judging from the market, teams are highly concerned about what Charles has left. He languished as a free agent far longer than a player with his resume should. He signed with the Broncos, on a near veteran minimum and no guaranteed money. At best, Charles will find himself in a timeshare with Anderson and Booker. At worst, he’s cut before the season starts. Charles is worth no more than an extremely late round flier.
Alvin Kamara NO (5)	52	85.18	5.67	14.02	TIER 8	RB	Kamara does not have a robust resume of work to show. What he does have are tremendous pass catching skills, and when he had the ball with at least a slight bit of momentum, he transformed into a man made of teflon. Then he landed in the perfect situation. A pass catching specialist, to the New Orleans Saints, a team that passes to the RB more than anyone else. Kamara is a great fit for the Saints. He will draw the obvious comparison to the Darren Sproles role. It’s unlikely he can match that production, but 50+ receptions his rookie year is not a pipedream.
Chris Thompson WAS (5)	54	82.32	4.00	0.00	TIER 8	RB	Thompson is a low-calorie version of a scatback. The substance seems to be there, but he’s lacking in that full body flavor. He can get you near 50 receptions, but the yardage doesn’t match what other PPR backs are putting up. He still has value with a defined role for a potent offense, but there could be a better option available in drafts when you would have to select him.
Joe Williams SF (11)	55	80.44	6.33	12.08	TIER 8	RB	The reports out of SF say that Joe Williams wasn’t even on the team's draft list. That is until Kyle Shanahan personally lobbied for him in the draft to the point that the team traded up to take him. There were already rumors that Hyde could be on the way out before the draft even took place. The Shanahan system has been fantastic for RBs going all the way back to the days of Kyle's pops Mike Shanahan. KShy worked a complete turnaround for Freeman two years ago, before that he lead the offense that saw Alfred Morris become a dominant fantasy RB. Keep an eye on this camp battle.
James White NE (9)	56	79.12	4.50	12.08	TIER 8	RB	The savior of the Super Bowl! He was rewarded with a delightful new contract, but the Patriots also gave about 52 other running backs new contracts as well. Maybe that's a little hyperbolic, but even still, White is a dicey fantasy asset. He will only be fully unleashed in negative game scripts for the Patriots, and it’s hard to see that happening on the regular. He’s also one of those PPR only types, he’s likely to have little value in a non-PPR.
Robert Turbin IND (11)	57	80.79	4.33	14.03	TIER 8	RB	The man with biceps the size of most people’s thighs has been getting a little pub lately. He morphed into a nasty goal line vulture last year, taking those prized TDs away from Frank Gore. Then the offseason opened with the team mentioning he may be getting more work. The team did add Marlon Mack, but he profiles as a more of a pass catcher. Turbin is a decent backup to take a chance on.
Jonathan Williams BUF (6)	58	75.17	4.33	13.01	TIER 8	RB	The backup in Buffalo is valuable. It’s as simple as that. Including Karlos Williams a few years ago, and Mike Gillislee last year. They will get carries and in positive situations. Plus Shady isn’t the most durable player in the NFL. The team didn’t do anything to add competition for Williams, so by all accounts, he is the handcuff for McCoy.
D'Onta Foreman HOU (7)	59	72.66	4.33	13.10	TIER 8	RB	The big man stays home. He goes from the Longhorns to the Texans to be Lamar Miller’s backup. Foreman could bring early value if he’s given a goal line role, but given his fumbling history, it’s hard to see this happening. A potential suspension looms as he was arrested in mid-July. While active, he is the handcuff for a run-first team though.
Dion Lewis NE (9)	60	66.39	8.00	13.12	TIER 8	RB	Dion’s role is very uncertain moving into 2017. Last year there was a ton of excitement for Lewis, but his ACL injury put him on the PUP to start the season and he couldn’t seem to get anything going once he returned. He had a few fumbles, an absolute no-no when playing for the Patriots. Then he tweaked his hamstring in the Super Bowl, just confirming his inability to stay healthy. With the addition of Burkhead and Gillislee, it’s no lock that Lewis makes the 53-man roster.
Jacquizz Rodgers TB (11)	60	73.13	4.67	8.12	TIER 8	RB	The TB running game is seemingly in a mess right now. With Martin starting the year with a 3 game suspension, it looks like Quizz could be the starter for a few weeks. He was far more productive and efficient than Martin last year. He’s going to be a great target later in drafts that can help fill in your RB slot, should you punt during the higher rounds. If he has another stretch like he had last year, it’s possible he stays involved in the offense when Doug Martin returns from suspension.
Jalen Richard OAK (10)	62	72.70	4.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Richard seemingly came out of nowhere last year. He gave the Raiders a boost on several occasions with huge chunk plays, showcased in his 5.9YPC. While Richard looked in a great position for 2017, the team brought Marshawn Lynch out of retirement, and Richard looks to again be a utility man with a limited number of touches.
Donnel Pumphrey PHI (10)	62	62.20	4.33	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Donnel Pumphrey is a very small back, similar in size to Darren Sproles. However, his college production was through the roof as a legitimate volume running back. Wtih positive camp news, negative reports on Wendell Smallwood, and a great offensive line, there might be an opportunity for a rookie breakout here.
T.J. Yeldon JAC (8)	64	70.28	5.83	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Maybe Yeldon didn’t really get a fair shake of things, but here we are. A few years into his career and his team has used the no.4 pick in the NFL draft on his replacement. Luckily for Yeldon, he showed some passing-game chops last year. Perhaps he can find a role as the 3rd down back. The Jags will likely make every attempt to have Fournette on the field at all times, but at least Yeldon has some trust built up with the team and his QB.
DeAndre Washington OAK (10)	64	69.59	4.33	14.01	TIER 9	RB	Washington’s outlook was a lot better before Marshawn joined the team. Washington is still an electric player who can rattle off chunk plays, but he’s not going to give consistent production. It’s not clear if he would become the starter if something happened to Lynch with Jalen Richard and Elijah Hood sure to get work in that event.
Marlon Mack IND (11)	66	61.10	6.67	13.02	TIER 9	RB	By all accounts, the Colts were in need of an RB. They have the ageless wonder, Frank Gore, holding things down, but his contract ends after 2017 and the team does need to look a little to the future. Marlon Mack is a gifted athlete. While he’s not likely to take over the starting job, we know pass catching running backs can have great value with Andrew Luck, ala Ahmad Bradshaw. Mack will start the year at the back of the depth chart but could force his way into some playing time.
Wendell Smallwood PHI (10)	67	59.05	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	The Eagles have used their actions to say that Smallwood is simply a backup. He’s merely a handcuff for Blount, and not really a high level one at that.
Devontae Booker DEN (5)	68	56.30	5.17	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Booker looked like a league winning handcuff stash last year when Anderson went down. Unfortunately he, for the most part, fell on his face. It was so bad the team even considered starting Kapri Bibbs over him. The positive spin is Booker can return to the auxiliary role he excelled in last year. The addition of Jamaal Charles makes things a bit murkier for Booker, but it’s too early to write his fantasy obituary.
Charles Sims TB (11)	69	52.06	5.67	0.00	TIER 9	RB	The table was fully set for Charles Sims to show the world what he was made of last year. He was coming into the season after a fantastic year, with over 1000 yards from scrimmage. Doug Martin went down to injury in Week 3. Sims took control of the Bucs RB situation and….nothing. After one good game and one terrible game, Sims left to the IR. By the time he was back he had fallen out of favor with the team. Now the Bucs have spent a 5th round pick on Jeremy McNichols, a player with a similar skill set to Sims. His time in Tampa could be ending quickly.
Tim Hightower SF (11)	70	54.03	4.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Hightower had 133 rushes for the Saints last season and brings a veteran presence to a young 49ers backfield with Carlos Hyde, rookie Joe Williams, and Kapri Bibbs. Hightower will probably be more of a fantasy nuisance for other 49ers RBs, than a fantasy asset himself in 2017.
Shane Vereen NYG (8)	71	49.67	5.00	14.02	TIER 9	RB	Vereen has been a solid contributor in PPR leagues, averaging 76 catches from 2013-2015. Torn triceps did lead to only 5 games played in 2016, but he seems to be fully healthy now. There should be plenty of opportunity for Vereen to do his thing, on a team that should struggle to run the ball.
Tarik Cohen CHI (9)	72	45.77	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Cohen has really flashed during preseason and could earn himself the 3rd down role for the Bears. Chicago should be playing from behind often, which could lead to plenty of dumpoffs to Cohen.
Jerick McKinnon MIN (9)	73	48.37	5.60	0.00	TIER 9	RB	McKinnon finds himself in a situation that he can’t out-athlete his way from. The team brought in Latavius Murray to replace Matt Asiata. Then the team moved up in the NFL draft for Dalvin Cook, a similar style of player to McKinnon, yet Cook is vastly superior. Jerick’s only hope will be to somehow hold onto the passing downs role he was excelling at towards the end of 2016. He’s likely to be mostly an afterthought and a what-could-have-been.
Wayne Gallman NYG (8)	74	46.29	6.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Gallman is a bit of a forgotten man despite playing for Clemson the National Champion. He’s not the most impressive player, and his situation isn’t the best. He was drafted by the Giants to go along with their endless amount of RBs. Perkins, Vereen, Draughn. Gallman does profile as a big-back and could earn goal line duties. But it’s a bad run blocking team, and they are certainly a pass first offense.
Chris Ivory JAC (8)	75	45.40	6.83	0.00	TIER 9	RB	“Here lies the once high potential of Chris Ivory’s fantasy value. Time of death: April 27th, 2017 just after the 4th pick in the NFL Draft”. The Jaguars had enough of their highly compensated free agents nonsense and took Leonard Fournette. With bad passing game chops, Ivory will only get on the field when Fournette deems him worthy, or he needs a breather. Ivory is back to being a handcuff, and not a great one at that.
Damien Williams MIA (11)	76	40.88	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Potential handcuff for Jay Ajayi. 2nd year player, Kenyan Drake, is in that backfield as well but all signs point the Williams being the primary backup and Drake being used as a pass catcher.
Aaron Jones GB (8)	77	37.58	7.17	0.00	TIER 9	RB	The Packers weren’t satisfied taking only Jamaal Williams and they selected Jones the very following round in the draft. Jones is an explosive player that can make big things happen. But, he’s still a bit raw and he doesn’t profile as full-time starter. Given the pass-happy nature of GB, he could still have some value, but his path to being a useable fantasy player this year is not clear.
DeAngelo Henderson DEN (5)	78	38.53	5.00	14.09	TIER 9	RB	Henderson has flashed during Preseason and could battle for the #2 role in Denver depending on the health of Jamaal Charles and Devontae Booker.
Jeremy McNichols TB (11)	79	33.97	7.33	0.00	TIER 9	RB	McNichols slipping to the 5th round was a little eye-opening for an RB that can do everything. He ended up in a good, albeit crowded, situation with Tampa Bay. Doug Martin was a huge letdown last year and is facing a 3 game suspension. Charles Sims was a disappointment when given his opportunity and can’t stay healthy. Jacquizz is a journeyman, yet may be their starter at the beginning of the year. There’s a path for McNichols, it’s a windy and hazardous path, but he could get some valuable playing time this season.
James Conner PIT (9)	80	30.27	3.67	14.07	TIER 9	RB	An absolutely delightful human interest story. James Conner couldn’t be stopped by anything, and that includes cancer. He would go receive his chemo treatments and then go to football practice. He played his college football at Pitt and then the Pittsburgh Steelers draft him. See? Just an amazing story. Now the frosting for this, he possibly becomes the highest value handcuff in fantasy football. Mike Tomlin has shown a commitment to a workhorse RB. It doesn’t matter if it’s Lev Bell, DeAngelo Williams, or Fitzgerald Toussaint. If you start for the Steelers, you will have major fantasy value. Bell has a major history of missing time, making Conner a great late-round flier. On top of that, Conner is a good RB prospect.
Alfred Morris DAL (6)	81	21.67	2.00	13.10	TIER 9	RB	With Ezekiel Elliott suspensed for 6 games, Alf could get some touches. McFadden is the clear projected starter though, and the Cowboys did bring in Ronnie Hillman.
Charcandrick West KC (10)	82	20.40	6.33	0.00	TIER 9	RB	West was a decent level handcuff, but the addition of Kareem Hunt likely pushes West further down the depth chart. Likely a stay away situation.
Fitzgerald Toussaint PIT (9)	83	16.77	3.67	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Toussaint is the backup to the backup for the Steelers. However, projected backup, James Conner suffered a minor shoulder injury in training camp. While he's not expected to miss significant time, Fitzgerald Toussaint is a name to keep an eye on.
Cameron Artis-Payne CAR (11)	84	6.73	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	RB	The backup to the backup. Nothing to see here.
Ryan Mathews FA	85	0.00	8.17	0.00	TIER 9	RB	Ryan Mathews has been released by the Eagles. Now we wait to see where he lands to determine if he has any fantasy value in 2017.
Antonio Brown PIT (9)	1	211.43	1.00	1.04	TIER 1	WR	Brown has solidified himself as one of the greatest receivers of our generation, and soon all-time. Here are his finishes among WRs in fantasy points in half point per reception scoring the past four seasons: 3, 1, 1, 6. The only game he missed in that span was last season when the Steelers benched their stud starters in Week 17 with nothing to play for. Ben Roethlisberger’s health is the biggest concern, but that isn’t enough reason to not take AB as the #1 wideout.
Julio Jones ATL (5)	2	200.30	3.83	1.06	TIER 1	WR	While foot injuries are an issue with Julio, he’s played 14 or more games in 4 of 6 seasons. In those seasons, he’s been a fantasy stud averaging over 1,500 receiving yards a season. Julio is a physical freak and game changer (300 yards receiving in Week 4 last year), but leaves fantasy owners wanting more in the TD department. His peak of 10 receiving TDs came once back in 2012. We’ll see if the Falcons miss offensive coordinator, Kyle Shanahan, or have a post-Super Bowl loss hangover, but as long as Julio is healthy, he will be a big producer.
Odell Beckham Jr NYG (8)	2	203.73	2.50	1.05	TIER 1	WR	OBJ has been lighting it up since he first took over for an injured Victor Cruz in 2014. Finishing 6th in fantasy points that rookie season in only 13 games, 5th in 2015, and 4th last year… the sky’s the limit for the 24-year-old. He’s had at least 1,300 yards and 10 TDs in each of his first three seasons.
Jordy Nelson GB (8)	4	195.63	3.17	1.11	TIER 1	WR	After missing all of 2015, Jordy came back in the biggest way possible last season, leading the league in receiving TDs with 14. While the top guys were only separated by a few points, it seems that the fantasy community is overlooking the fact that he finished FIRST among WRs in fantasy points in Half PPR last season. He’ll be 32 when the season starts but showed last season that as long as he’s healthy, he’s a Top 5 guy. He’s the #1 target of the #1 quarterback in fantasy.
A.J. Green CIN (6)	5	185.73	2.67	1.10	TIER 2	WR	A.J. was on a tear, leading the league in receiving yards before going down in Week 11 with a hamstring injury. He wanted to return to action in Week 17 but the organization wouldn’t let their star receiver risk it. 2016 was the first season of A.J. Green’s career in which he didn’t top 1000 receiving yards, and was clearly on pace to do it again before the injury. He remains an elite talent and clearly has established a rapport with QB Andy Dalton over the past 6 seasons when both entered the league.
Mike Evans TB (11)	6	183.83	3.33	1.09	TIER 2	WR	It was a massive breakout season for Mike Evans in 2016 with over 1300 receiving yards and 12 TDs. While he’s clearly a supreme talent and should continue to get better along with young QB, Jameis Winston, there are new receiving weapons in town. After leading the league in targets in 2016, his target share could take a big hit in 2017.
Michael Thomas NO (5)	7	168.43	4.00	2.03	TIER 3	WR	What a rookie season with a receiving line of 92/1137/9- finishing 7th among WRs in fantasy points in Half PPR scoring. He has one of the best QBs of all-time throwing him the ball in Drew Brees, and is now the main receiving weapon with Brandin Cooks headed to New England. Defenses could focus on him more in 2017, and Brees is known to spread the ball, but Thomas should be in line for another year as a WR1.
T.Y. Hilton IND (11)	8	162.24	3.67	2.12	TIER 3	WR	T.Y. showed flashes of greatness in years prior but last season was truly his breakout as he led the league in receiving yards. With Donte Moncrief missing multiple games due to injury, Hilton was 4th in the league in targets. While his targets may decrease, he’s still in the prime of his career at 27, and has one of the best QBs in the game throwing him the ball.
Dez Bryant DAL (6)	8	168.50	5.67	2.07	TIER 3	WR	Can Dez get back to being a Top 5 WR this season? Everyone knows the talent is there, but a foot injury has really hampered him the past two seasons. He finished Top 7 or better in the three seasons prior. He and Dak Prescott seemed to really connect in the 2016 playoffs, so there’s big potential if they can carry that momentum into 2017. While he’s never topped 93 receptions in a season, if he can stay healthy, he should battle for the league lead in receiving TDs.
Amari Cooper OAK (10)	10	155.15	3.67	2.09	TIER 3	WR	Could this be the year that Amari Cooper passes his fellow teammate WR, Michael Crabtree? Drafted 4th overall in the 2015 NFL Draft, Amari enters his 3rd season, which is traditionally known as the breakout year for wideouts. While he’s had a great start to his NFL career, topping 1000 yards in each, fantasy owners have wanted more consistency. The Oakland offense is no joke with Derek Carr getting better each year of his young career. Amari could breakout in 2017, but that assumption will most likely cost you your 2nd Round pick.
Terrelle Pryor WAS (5)	11	149.12	5.17	3.05	TIER 4	WR	A rare success story of a QB turned WR; Pryor finished as the WR20 with 77 receptions and 1,007 receiving yards in a terrible Browns offense last season. He gets a massive QB upgrade with Kirk Cousins in Washington, however, the main concern is target share. He was pretty much the only show in town for the Browns, while the Redskins have weapons Jordan Reed, Jamison Crowder, and Josh Doctson. So while the target quality may be significantly better, the quantity could be significantly worse.
Doug Baldwin SEA (6)	12	146.75	2.50	3.03	TIER 4	WR	Dougie Baldwin has defied expectations two years in a row now. He and Russell Wilson finished on a tear in 2015, when he finished tied as the league leader in receiving TDs with 14 of them. While those 2nd half numbers weren’t quite repeated in 2016, he established himself as Wilson’s #1 target, finishing as the WR8 overall. There are few receivers who can mainly play out of the slot and be a premier fantasy producer. Doug Baldwin is the best of them.
Alshon Jeffery PHI (10)	12	146.87	6.50	4.03	TIER 4	WR	Alshon showed a ton of potential finishing as a Top 10 receiver in his 2nd and 3rd season in the NFL. However, the past two seasons have been rough, dealing with injuries and a PED suspension to close out the 2016 season. Now he has a one-year prove it deal with Philadelphia, where QB Carson Wentz showed a lot of promise last season as a rookie. He needs to live up to his potential if he’s going to be worth his draft price at the back of the 3rd Round.
Allen Robinson JAC (8)	14	145.70	4.80	4.10	TIER 4	WR	Was Allen Robinson’s amazing 2015 campaign a fluke or was it his disappointing 2016? He seems to be an elite talent capped by bad QB play from Blake Bortles. Garbage time (playing from behind) led Blake and ARob to big fantasy numbers in 2015 finishing with 1400 receiving yards and 14 TDs. However, it didn’t work out so well in 2016 when his numbers plummeted to 883 yards and 6 TDs. The Jaguars offense could have a much better rushing attack after drafting RB Leonard Fournette 4th overall this year. That, plus the return of the other Allen wide receiver, Allen Hurns, could lead to more efficiency for Robinson and Bortles in 2017.
Martavis Bryant PIT (9)	15	146.00	9.17	4.08	TIER 4	WR	Bryant is an ultimate high risk/high upside wideout this season. Still just 25 years old, Martavis is back from suspension and should put up big numbers if he stays on the field. The Steelers drafted JuJu Smith-Schuster in the 2nd Round but Martavis is the clear #2 WR on the high powered Steelers offense.
Brandin Cooks NE (9)	16	144.93	6.50	2.12	TIER 4	WR	One of the fastest playmakers in the league is now a new weapon for Tom Brady. He’s topped 1100 yards and 8 TDs each of the past two seasons of his young career. The pro argument- the Patriots traded a 1st Round pick for him, so must have big plans to utilize him. The con argument- Tom Brady has Gronk, Julian Edelman, Malcolm Mitchell, Chris Hogan, and Dwayne Allen to throw the ball to. Therefore, Cooks’ targets will suffer and he will continue to be a boom/bust wideout. Whichever side you believe, his ADP is back of the 2nd Round.
Davante Adams GB (8)	17	143.03	5.00	4.06	TIER 4	WR	Well, we went from “Davante Adams stinks!” to “Davante Adams scored 12 TDs last year.” He quickly became Aaron Rodgers’ #2 target behind Jordy Nelson, and the lack of a running game led to a ton of red zone targets. While some are expecting a Randall Cobb resurgence, until we see otherwise, Adams is still the #2 target for Aaron Rodgers.
Demaryius Thomas DEN (5)	18	143.70	3.00	3.10	TIER 4	WR	Consistent but no longer elite. Thomas was a Top 5 WR in 2012-2014 but has trailed off the past two seasons. Of course, you have to somewhat attribute those Top 5 seasons to when future hall of famer, Peyton Manning, was still throwing him the ball. Peyton played a majority of games in 2015 as well but clearly had lost a step. Demaryius will be 29 years old when the season starts, and his QB situation isn’t great. However, he’s had at least 90 receptions and 1000 receiving yards in 5 years straight. As mentioned before, very consistent but no longer elite.
Michael Crabtree OAK (10)	19	142.98	3.00	4.11	TIER 4	WR	What a resurgence Crabtree has had since leaving the dysfunctional 49ers offense. Matt Harmon’s Reception Perception data showed that Crabtree had plenty left, and he has really thrived in Oakland, finishing with 9 TDs in 2015, and 8 last year. The Raiders offense should be one of the best in the league, with a great offensive line and emerging young QB, Derek Carr. While Amari Cooper could take over as the top WR in Oakland, Crabtree will continue to to be a reliable fantasy contributor.
DeAndre Hopkins HOU (7)	20	142.67	5.00	3.08	TIER 4	WR	Can DeShaun Watson be the savior for DeAndre Hopkins’ fantasy production? The fantasy community is split on that question. He’s a very talented physical receiver, who can outmuscle defenders with the best of them. He saw 41 less targets in 2016 than 2015, and finished with a whopping SEVEN less TDs. Some will point directly to the poor QB play of Brock Osweiler as the sole reason, while others will tell you not to expect much better in 2017 due to a heavy run game and strong defense for the Texans. Note: He hasn’t missed a game in his 4-year career.
Sammy Watkins LAR (8)	21	140.84	7.33	5.08	TIER 4	WR	Long story short, super talented but often injured. He topped 1000 yards and had 9 TDs in only 13 games played in 2015. Missing 11 games in his three-year career and often playing injured, many aren’t willing to take the risk on Sammy. | Watkins, shockingly, finds himself moving teams down to LA to catch passes from Jared Goff. It’s not a complete fantasy death sentence, Kenny Britt was able to scrounge up 1000 yards last year. Unfortunately, Watkins specialty of deep plays was not a specialty of the Rams QBs.
Tyreek Hill KC (10)	22	141.35	6.00	4.03	TIER 5	WR	Tyreek “The Freak” burst onto the NFL and fantasy scene during the 2nd half of his 2016 rookie season. In Weeks 9-17 he finished 10th among WRs in Standard scoring. He was a weapon in so many ways with 6 receiving TDs, 3 rushing TDs, 1 punt return for a TD, AND 2 kick returns for TDs. That’s 12 total touchdowns, all while playing just 41% of snaps for the Chiefs on the season. Head coach, Andy Reid, has said Tyreek will see more snaps this season, but the Chiefs offense has been a weak spot for WR fantasy production. The team wasn't joking about more snaps, as they released their WR1 Jeremy Maclin. Hill now has a tremendous opportunity, but his ADP is basically drafting his ceiling.
Kelvin Benjamin CAR (11)	23	139.87	5.67	5.01	TIER 5	WR	Coming off a big rookie season with 9 receiving TDs, it was unfortunate to see Benjamin miss all of 2015 with a torn ACL. So last season, after starting the first two weeks of the season with 199 yards and 3 TDs, Benjamin went ice cold in Week 3... as in ZERO points. He then averaged around 8 fantasy points a week in Half PPR scoring from Weeks 4-14 before producing respectable numbers again in Weeks 15 and 16, after owners had already given up on him. He still finished as the WR24 in 2016 as the Panthers offense struggled. The Panthers now have rookie weapons, Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel, which could lead to more red zone scoring opportunities for Kelvin Benjamin.
Keenan Allen LAC (9)	24	138.09	7.33	4.01	TIER 5	WR	Another elite talent who seemingly can’t stay healthy. After finishing as the WR18 in his rookie season, he played 14 games in 2014, 8 in 2015, and went down for the season in the first game of 2016. He was a target monster in those 8 games of 2015, and has a great veteran QB in Philip Rivers throwing him the ball. The talent is there, but besides the health issue, there are many good receiving weapons in the Chargers offense.
Larry Fitzgerald ARI (8)	25	137.23	2.17	6.02	TIER 5	WR	Entering his 13th season, old man Larry continues to show why he’s one of the best of all-time. While his days of dominating as an elite outside receiver are done, he led the league in receptions last year so clearly gets a bump in PPR leagues. As long as QB Carson Palmer stays healthy, Larry Fitz should be a lock for Top 20 WR in Half and Full PPR leagues.
Brandon Marshall NYG (11)	26	136.57	6.17	5.07	TIER 5	WR	Marshall went from the WR3 in 2015 to the WR50 in 2016, with only one less game played in 2016. The Jets’ offense was a true dumpster fire though, and he’s now on the other New York team. The Giants offense has the receiving weapons to be elite, with young stud, Odell Beckham Jr., leading the way. Marshall has over 100 receptions in 6 different seasons and over 1000 yards in 8/11 seasons. With OBJ sure to get his share, and BMarsh at 33 years old, his Top 5 days are over. However, if the offense is indeed elite, he has high end WR2 upside.
Golden Tate DET (7)	27	135.50	2.67	5.12	TIER 5	WR	Over the past 10 seasons, the Lions have been Top 9 or higher in passing plays among NFL teams. While Golden Tate is the #1 receiving option on this offense, he’s shown that he doesn’t fit the prototypical WR1 mold averaging just 5.2 TDs over the past 5 seasons. His overall ceiling is capped but he surely has a safe season floor, with 90+ receptions each of the past 3 seasons.Rookie WR, Kenny Golladay, could help open things up as well.
Jeremy Maclin BAL (10)	28	135.59	5.00	8.12	TIER 5	WR	Maclin struggled through injuries in 2016, only playing in 12 games. When healthy he’s shown to be a talented receiver during his 8 year career, topping 80 receptions twice, 1000 yards twice and 10 TDs twice. He was cut by the Chiefs and ended up signing on with the Ravens. This is actually an upgrade for his fantasy outlook. Joe Flacco has a history of heavily targeting his no.1 option.
DeSean Jackson TB (11)	29	133.27	5.83	7.09	TIER 5	WR	Mr. Boom or Bust joins the emerging Buccaneers offense, led by 3rd year QB Jameis Winston, and young superstar WR, Mike Evans. The offense needed more weapons badly and veteran deep threat, DeSean Jackson, is a perfect fit. He can blow up for a big game at any point but is hard to trust as a consistent fantasy producer. He’s only played a full season twice in his 9-year career and has only surpassed 62 receptions in one season. In those 9 seasons, he’s been a WR1 twice and a WR2 twice, finishing outside the Top 24 among wideouts the other 5 seasons.
Julian Edelman NE (9)	30	133.87	4.33	6.05	TIER 5	WR	Edelman has been Brady’s go-to wide receiver. Like Jarvis Landry, he’s been one of the receivers who gets a major bump in PPR leagues, but has a very limited upside. Edelman was 3rd in the league in targets last season but you wouldn’t know it if you owned him in Standard scoring where he scored 18% of his fantasy points in Week 17. Edelman is hard to project with young stud, Brandin Cooks, coming to town. Brady likes to spread the wealth but Edelman should still get his. His value in PPR leagues is obvious as he’s being drafted two entire rounds later in Standard leagues than PPR.
Emmanuel Sanders DEN (5)	30	133.40	3.50	7.07	TIER 5	WR	Often overlooked, Emmanuel Sanders has been a consistent fantasy producer, finishing as a Top 20 WR the past 2 seasons, and Top 5 in 2014 with an elite Peyton Manning throwing the ball. While his Top 10 potential may be gone, he certainly has the skills and potential to win weeks for owners. He had 28 points in the first week of the fantasy playoffs last season, helping many owners move to the next round. Demaryius Thomas remains the top target and rookie Carlos Henderson could make an impact, but Sanders is still being undervalued.
Devante Parker MIA (11)	32	132.67	6.00	8.05	TIER 6	WR	Is this the breakout year for DeVante Parker? After being a 1st Round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, Parker has left fantasy owners wanting more the past two seasons with a combined 82 catches for 1238 yards and 7 TDs. However, we have to remember that the classic standard is three years for a WR to truly get acclimated at the NFL level. With fellow Dolphins WR, Jarvis Landry, having his role locked in, it’s hard to project how much Parker can do in a Miami offense who was last in the league in Pass plays in 2016. Still, the draft pedigree and talent is there, we’ll see if he can put it all together and make his targets count.
Jarvis Landry MIA (11)	33	133.00	2.67	6.03	TIER 6	WR	Jarvis gets a bump in PPR leagues averaging 96 receptions over his first three seasons in the NFL. Unfortunately, he has Ryan Tannehill throwing him the ball instead of Tom Brady. Some are expecting highly drafted fellow WR, Devante Parker, to breakout this year but regardless, Landry is locked into his role, and therefore his ceiling is capped.
Stefon Diggs MIN (9)	34	131.08	5.83	6.11	TIER 6	WR	Diggs has shown flashes of being a great receiver. However, he’s missed 3 games in each of his first two NFL seasons. In 13 games last year, he finished with 84 receptions for 903 yards and 3 TDs. He’ll be a real value if he can play a full season, especially in PPR leagues. His TD ceiling may be capped due to the Vikings offense though.
Jamison Crowder WAS (5)	35	128.40	4.17	6.10	TIER 6	WR	"Crowdahh" emerged as a solid fantasy producer in 2016, especially in PPR formats. With 10 weeks of double-digit fantasy points, he sneakily had 7 TDs as well. WRs: Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson have left Washington (214 targets). However, Terrelle Pryor is coming to town, and when TE Jordan Reed is on the field- HE is Kirk Cousins’ go-to target. Crowder will still have plenty of opportunity in his 3rd NFL season and should push for 80 receptions.
Donte Moncrief IND (11)	36	128.73	6.33	8.10	TIER 6	WR	Mr. Donte “Slapa da Bass” Moncrief has had a great connection with rising star QB, Andrew Luck, when they’ve both been healthy. Moncrief finished the 2016 season with 7 receiving TDs in just 9 games played. Luck being injured in 2015, and Moncrief being injured in 2016, has made it tough for consistent fantasy production. Still only 24 years old and entering his 4th season, Moncrief could be a big value in 2017.
Eric Decker TEN (8)	37	126.43	5.17	8.02	TIER 6	WR	It was so unfortunate seeing Decker go down in Week 3 and missing the rest of the 2016 season. Year after year he’s been a value pick topping 1000 yards and double-digit TDs in 3 of the past 5 seasons. | Decker has signed on with the Titans. It's not the most amazing destination in the world, being a very run first team, but it could be a combo of super powers. His new QB, Marcus Mariota, was inhuman when it came to red zone effiency, and Decker is a monster in that same area.
Willie Snead NO (5)	38	128.02	3.83	6.09	TIER 6	WR	Two words explain why you should have the NEED For Snead: Drew Brees. With Brandin Cooks being traded to the Patriots, Snead is primed to step into the WR2 role for the high-octane Saints offense. Lots of targets from Drew Brees = lots of fantasy points. They did bring in deep threat Ted Ginn Jr., who could be a nice sleeper pick. Still, Snead grades out extremely well in Matt Harmon's Reception Perception data. He should be locked and loaded for a productive season, and could finish as a high-end WR2 in fantasy.
Pierre Garcon SF (11)	38	125.67	4.00	8.05	TIER 6	WR	Garcon heads to San Francisco to reunite with offensive guru, Kyle Shanahan. The last time they were together in Washington, in 2013, Garcon had 113 receptions for over 1300 yards. Garcon’s next highest totals came in 2016 with 79 catches and 1041 yards. He’ll be 31 when the season starts but showed last year that he has enough left in the tank to have WR2 upside in Shanahan’s offense.
Tyrell Williams LAC (9)	40	126.60	6.00	9.03	TIER 6	WR	Tyrell Williams came out of nowhere in 2016, finishing as a WR2 in all scoring formats. Keenan Allen went down early, and that opened up the opportunity for Tyrell Williams to become one of Philip Rivers’ main targets. Entering 2017, Keenan Allen is healthy, and the Chargers used this year’s 7th overall pick on WR Mike Williams. However, Mike Williams has had injury woes during OTAs, and hasn't been able to work with Philip Rivers and the offense. Tyrell could end up being a big value in 2017.
Kenny Britt CLE (9)	41	124.55	4.67	10.12	TIER 6	WR	Britt broke 1000 yards for the first time in his 8 year career last season. He’s headed to Cleveland where he’ll compete with 2nd year WR Corey Coleman and rookie TE, David Njoku for targets. The Browns offense seems to be on the uptick, but the targets could very well come from shaky QB play.
Ted Ginn NO (5)	42	123.70	4.83	11.12	TIER 7	WR	Ginn will now fill in the Brandin Cooks deep threat role for Drew Brees and the Saints. Expect some big weeks, but plenty of dismal weeks as well.
Cameron Meredith CHI (9)	43	119.00	5.50	9.06	TIER 7	WR	Meredith showed flashes in 2016, finishing with 888 yards on a bad offense. The offense may not be much improved but Meredith is a late-round sleeper for many as he finished the season on a high note averaging 93 receiving yards over the last 4 weeks of the season. There’s also not much competition in Chicago with Alshon Jeffery headed for Philly.
Adam Thielen MIN (9)	44	119.83	5.00	11.05	TIER 7	WR	Fantasy owners who started him during Championship Week last year are certainly “Hooked on a Thielen.” He went off for 12 catches for 200 yards and 2 TDs, almost finishing the year with 1000 yards in his 3rd NFL season. He will share targets with mainly Stefon Diggs, and Kyle Rudolph and battle to be a WR3 in fantasy.
Jordan Matthews BUF (6)	45	118.87	5.83	10.10	TIER 7	WR	2016 was a down year for Matthews with a receiving line of 73/804/3, after starting his career with 8 TDs in each of his first two seasons. Matthews has now been traded to the Bills, just as the Bills traded away stud receiver, Sammy Watkins. For now, Matthews will only have to compete with rookie, Zay Jones at WR. Matthews and Jones, have both been predominantly slot WRs in the past few years. The Bills did give up a lot to get Matthews, sending a solid DB Ronald Darby and a 3rd round pick.
Marvin Jones DET (7)	46	114.37	5.83	10.07	TIER 7	WR	Marvin’s first few games as a member of the Lions made fantasy owners feel like they struck gold. In Week 3 he finished with 202 yards and 2 TDs. Then in Weeks 4-17 he averaged under 7 points a week in Half PPR. The Lions drafted rookie WR, Kenny Golladay, in the 3rd Round this season. Until further notice, Marvin Jones remains the #2 receiver behind Golden Tate on an offense that has been Top 9 in pass plays for the past decade. He could be a fantasy value if he develops any sort of consistency.
Kenny Stills MIA (11)	47	116.00	4.17	14.11	TIER 7	WR	The Dolphins resigned Stills as their deep receiving threat. We’ve most likely seen his upside last season with 9 receiving TDs on just 42 receptions. It’s a run-first offense with two other talented receivers in Jarvis Landry and DeVante Parker.
Mike Wallace BAL (10)	47	113.64	3.17	11.06	TIER 7	WR	Wallace defied the doubters, finishing with 72 catches for just over 1000 yards in 2016. While the offseason sleeper buzz was growing, now Wallace returns to being a WR2 behind Jeremy Maclin. He can still put together a solid fantasy season and prove to be a value in drafts, but Maclin should be the team's WR1.
Corey Coleman CLE (9)	49	111.17	5.33	10.11	TIER 7	WR	In 2016, Corey Coleman was the 1st wideout selected in the NFL Draft. After a 2 TD performance in Week 2, Coleman broke his hand in practice and missed Weeks 3-8. Upon return and the rest of the season, he wasn’t a fantasy option. The dismal Browns offense, and Coleman’s injury hampered his ability to get acclimated in that rookie season. The Browns have already improved their offensive line, and drafted QB DeShone Kizer. The top Browns’ WR from last season, Terrelle Pryor, is off to Washington but the Browns brought in Kenny Britt. Coleman could be this year’s #1 target in Cleveland.
Randall Cobb GB (8)	49	111.90	6.50	9.01	TIER 7	WR	Cobb blew up for 12 TDs in 2014 but has been fairly disappointing since, while dealing with injuries. Davante Adams has taken over the WR2 role for Green Bay, but the WR3 for Aaron Rodgers has been fantasy productive over the years. Cobb peaked in 2014, but could be a WR2 in fantasy leagues if he can stay healthy.
Josh Doctson WAS (5)	51	109.99	7.00	13.06	TIER 7	WR	After being drafted in the 1st Round of the 2016 NFL Draft, Doctson ended up missing Weeks 3-17 due to injury. There are a lot of mouths to feed in Washington with Terrelle Pryor coming to town, Jamison Crowder, and Jordan Reed there. However, Crowder is more of a slot receiver so if Doctson can stay healthy, he could see enough of the target share to make a mark.
John Brown ARI (8)	52	107.04	6.00	9.11	TIER 7	WR	John Brown has shown flashes of greatness in his first 3 seasons. He topped 1000 yards and had 7 TDs in 2015, before dealing with injuries during a disappointing 2016 campaign. IF healthy, he's the clear #2 receiving option behind Larry Fitzgerald. However, already throughout training camp and preseason, he's dealt with injuries and missed time. With John Brown sidelined, head coach Bruce Arians has already said Jaron (not John) Brown is currently the #2 WR. If you want to take a shot on John Brown being healthy when Week 1 arrives, he could be a big value.
Robby Anderson NYJ (11)	53	102.97	7.50	14.12	TIER 7	WR	Anderson was getting targets late last season for the Jets. However, he started out the offseason being arrested and charged with a felony count of resisting arrest with violence and obstruction of justice. Hard to know what if any kind of role he’ll have for the Jets this season.
Taylor Gabriel ATL (5)	54	102.82	4.33	11.09	TIER 7	WR	Gabriel was a surprising fantasy contributor in the 2nd half of 2016. He averaged 15 points in Half PPR from Weeks 6-12. However, he missed the final 3 games of the season due to injury and offensive guru, Kyle Shanahan, is no longer with the team. If the Falcons offensive is still elite, there will be weeks when Gabriel is worth owning as a bye-week fill-in or flex option.
Cole Beasley DAL (6)	55	103.67	3.33	14.01	TIER 8	WR	If you listened to the show last season, you know that Mike certainly had a case of the Beasles! He had a stretch of fantasy relevance, especially in PPR leagues, and especially while Dez Bryant missed time. While Beasley may maintain his slot receiver role for another season, Dallas did draft Ryan Switzer in the 4th Round, who seems to be a younger version of Beasley himself.
Allen Hurns JAC (8)	56	102.23	5.33	14.01	TIER 8	WR	Do you remember that in 2015 Allen Hurns was the WR15 in Half PPR? He had 10 TDs while he and fellow Jags WR, Allen Robinson broke out. However, last year was not good for the Jaguars offense, finishing 25th in points scored. Hurns missed the final 5 weeks of the season, but should be back as the WR2 option for the Jaguars. How valuable that spot is in 2017 remains to be seen.
Rishard Matthews TEN (8)	57	99.30	5.33	11.10	TIER 8	WR	Matthews’ first season in Tennessee was a great success, averaging over 14 points a game in PPR scoring from Weeks 4-17. He and Marcus Mariota got in sync and were extremely efficient together in the middle of the season. Now the Titans bring in the top WR prospect in the 2017 NFL Draft Class, Corey Davis, as well as 3rd round pick, Taywan Taylor. | It's been tough for Matthews truthers to hold on after the addition of Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor. The addition of Eric Decker is likely too much to place any kind of fantasy faith in Matthews.
Sterling Shepard NYG (8)	57	96.20	4.50	13.04	TIER 8	WR	Shepard had a solid rookie season with 65 catches for 683 yards and 8 TDs. He is 1/15 rookies in NFL history with that receiving stat line (or better). With veteran Brandon Marshall and 2017 1st Round pick, Evan Engram, joining the team, it’s hard to see Shepard getting more than the 105 targets he had in 2016.
Kevin White CHI (9)	59	97.17	8.33	14.04	TIER 8	WR	Drafted in the 7th overall at the 2015 NFL Draft, Kevin White, missed all of the 2015 season, then only played 4 games last season. The draft pedigree is there but nothing else until we see it on the NFL field.
Marqise Lee JAC (8)	60	93.10	5.83	0.00	TIER 8	WR	Lee had a few weeks of fantasy relevance in PPR leagues, but most likely won’t see enough targets to be a reliable contributor. As long as Allen Hurns is healthy, he should remain the 2nd WR target in the Jaguars offense, with Allen Robinson as the #1.
Corey Davis TEN (8)	61	92.71	5.83	10.03	TIER 8	WR	Corey Davis was the highest rated rookie WR according to most analysts. The Titans agreed, taking him with the 5th overall pick in the NFL Draft. His landing spot is near perfect in the long run being paired with Marcus Mariota on a team that was needing a WR1. However, in year one it will be difficult to produce high end numbers on what is currently a run first team. All this before they signed talented WR, Eric Decker.
Kenny Golladay DET (7)	62	89.93	5.00	12.04	TIER 8	WR	Remember when Marvin Jones broke out early last season? The Lions need a bigger downfield threat that won’t disappear and they found that guy in Kenny Golladay. At 6’4” and running a 4.50 40 yard dash, Golladay has the talent to force his way into the starting lineup on a pass happy team. If he breaks into a starter role this year, he might just find his way onto many fantasy teams by midseason.
Brandon LaFell CIN (6)	63	89.13	6.43	0.00	TIER 8	WR	The Bengals resigned LaFell to a 2 year deal in the offseason. He did OK filling in for A.J. Green at the end of 2016. Now they bring in John Ross with the 9th overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft. If the Bengals unleash Ross in year one, LaFell won’t see many targets.
John Ross CIN (6)	64	85.43	6.60	12.11	TIER 8	WR	Ross has received a lot of publicity for breaking the all time NFL Combine record for the 40 yard dash. However, Ross is more than just fast. Unlike Will Fuller coming out last season, Ross has a complete package of routes and more tools to use. Opposite AJ Green, Ross should be able to use those tools to find success. The biggest question will be whether Marvin Lewis will actually unleash Ross in his rookie season or make him pay his dues.
Chris Conley KC (10)	65	85.73	4.67	0.00	TIER 8	WR	He’s the WR2 or WR3 on a Chiefs offense that barely supports a single WR fantasy wise.
Tyler Lockett SEA (6)	66	83.23	6.67	13.11	TIER 8	WR	After an exciting 2015 rookie season, there was a lot of buzz over Lockett headed into 2016. Being drafted in the 7th Round of fantasy drafts, it was an extremely disappointing season for Lockett. The Seahawks offense struggled as Russell Wilson dealt with injuries. Then Lockett himself suffered a devastating leg injury in Week 16 to end the season. Until we see otherwise, the only fantasy relevant WR in Seattle is Doug Baldwin.
Robert Woods LAR (8)	66	84.16	3.50	0.00	TIER 8	WR	Woods got paid big time by the Rams despite single season career highs of 65 catches, 699 yards, and 5 TDs. They also drafted two WRs this year in Cooper Kupp and Josh Reynolds | The Rams weren’t done adding WRs this offseason and have made some big noise by trading for Sammy Watkins. Woods didn’t profile as a lead dog, and the team made a move accordingly. Woods late round sleeper value has vanished.
Devin Funchess CAR (11)	68	83.03	5.40	14.04	TIER 8	WR	Funchess enters his 3rd NFL season after being drafted in the 2nd Round of the 2015 NFL Draft. The Panthers’ WR1, Kelvin Benjamin, has disappointed lately, as did the Panthers offense as a whole in 2016. With Ted Ginn (95 targets) headed to New Orleans, Funchess could see increased targets, but is not worth fantasy consideration until we see otherwise.
Mohamed Sanu ATL (5)	69	81.43	4.00	14.02	TIER 9	WR	As high powered as the Falcons offense was last season, Sanu wasn’t much of a contributor. If Julio Jones were to miss time, Sanu would probably see increased targets. Beyond that, it’s hard to count on him finishing above a WR4.
Zay Jones BUF (6)	70	82.65	5.00	12.02	TIER 9	WR	Jones was a prolific collegiate producer at the WR position at a small school. Then he shocked most analysts by posting great measurables as a 90th percentile athlete. Some question if he is a big slot receiver, a la Jordan Matthews, or if he can be an outside threat in the NFL. His landing spot allows him the opportunity to make a big impact right away as the #2 WR, although the Bills passing volume will limit Jones’ upside | It appears the Bills don’t believe that Jones profiles like Jordan Matthews, because they just traded for Matthews. It’s going to be interesting to see how the offensive alignment sets up between these two players. Anquan Boldin was in the mix until he decided to retire during Week 2 of preaseason.
J.J. Nelson ARI (8)	71	79.93	5.83	14.07	TIER 9	WR	Nelson will battle with Jaron Brown and rookie, Chad Williams, for the WR3 role on the Cardinals offense. He had a few big weeks in 2016, but only topped 100 yards once, and will be hard to trust at all on a weekly basis.
Breshad Perriman BAL (10)	72	76.95	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Perriman missed all of 2015 after being drafted in the 1st Round of the NFL Draft. While he wasn’t fantasy relevant in 2016, he now has an actual on-field season under his belt. He's simply the team's WR3 now behind Mike Wallace and the newly signed Jeremy Maclin.
Terrance Williams DAL (6)	73	77.47	3.17	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Terrance Williams was irrelevant in fantasy last season, never seeing more than 6 targets in any game. Dallas surprisingly re-signed him this offseason but, his lack of fantasy production should remain.
Nelson Agholor PHI (10)	74	73.72	8.67	14.10	TIER 9	WR	There was plenty of Nelson Agholor buzz two years ago when the Chip Kelly led Eagles drafted him in the 1st Round of the NFL Draft. Agholor’s receiving line through his first two seasons is 59 catches for 648 yards, and 3 TDs; hardly what you want from a 1st Round talent | Things have changed drastically for Agholor. A sudden surge of positive news began to surface from training camp. While it seemed like fluff, the team has backed up this support by trading away Jordan Matthews to the Bills. It certainly seems like Agholor will be manning the slot for the Eagles this year, giving him at least some fantasy value.
ArDarius Stewart NYJ (11)	75	76.93	5.67	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Stewart might be less known to the casual football fan, but for the NFL Draft crowd, Stewart was a favorite for many. He's headed to a terrible team and quality of targets is questionable at best. However, the targets could certainly be there for Stewart with Eric Decker gone. ArDarius has had thumb and groin injuries this offseason and hopes to be ready for training camp.
Marquise Goodwin SF (11)	75	75.87	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Goodwin is a deep threat that could end up being the WR2 for San Francisco. Perhaps new 49ers head coach/offensive coordinator, Kyle Shanahan, can utilize Goodwin the way he did Taylor Gabriel last season. The problem is that the surrounding talent is not even close to Atlanta’s.
Tyler Boyd CIN (6)	77	70.89	4.50	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Boyd was a non-factor in 2016, and now the Bengals have not only resigned Brandon LaFell but also spent their 2017 1st Round pick on speedster, John Ross. Boyd is likely the WR4 on the Bengals offense.
Tavon Austin LAR (8)	78	101.47	3.53	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Tavon Austin’s single season highs are 58 catches, 509 yards, and 5 TDs. In 2015, he added a rushing line of 52/434/4 to put him just outside of WR2 range but was nowhere close to that in 2016. The Rams brought in WR Robert Woods, drafted two more WRs, and now traded for Sammy Watkins. Avoid Tavon.
Torrey Smith PHI (10)	78	71.33	6.17	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Now on the Eagles, Alshon Jeffery is the clear WR1 and Nelson Agholor and Zach Ertz are still there. Smith could be next in line for targets, but don’t get too excited - he’s only finished as a WR2 once in his 6-year career.
Jaron Brown ARI (8)	80	73.67	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	No, Jaron is not a typo. There are two J. Brown's in Arizona, and Jaron actually appears to be the healthier of the two. Jaron is a tall (6'2"), fast (4.4, 40) wide receiver that fits what Bruce Arians system looks for. They signed him to a new one year contract last season AFTER he tore his ACL, which should show you how the Cardinals feel about his potential.
Chris Hogan NE (9)	81	69.63	6.17	14.06	TIER 9	WR	One of many secondary receiving weapons for Tom Brady. Maybe a bye week fill-in for deeper leagues, or flex-worthy if there’s an injury or two in front of him.
Will Fuller HOU (7)	82	62.13	4.83	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Speedster Will Fuller was drafted in the 1st Round of the 2016 NFL Draft. After topping 100 yards in each of his first two games, it looked like he could be a fantasy contributor in his rookie season. That faded quickly as the Texans offense did. He will have the occasional big play, but until we see rookie QB, Deshaun Watson, make a big impact on the offense as a whole, Fuller is outside of WR4 range. Update: A broken collarbone during training camp has Fuller out for at least the first 4 weeks of the season, probably longer.
Eli Rogers PIT (9)	83	64.13	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Rogers is most likely the WR4 or WR5 on the Steelers roster. Without injury in front of him, it’s hard to see him being fantasy relevant in 2016.
Jeremy Kerley SF (11)	84	59.77	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	The 49ers brought in offensive guru, Kyle Shanahan, but also brought in WR Pierre Garcon to be the #1 WR there. Kerley may be the #2 but that won’t mean much until we see that offense improve in a major way.
Jaelen Strong HOU (7)	85	63.65	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Jaelen Strong should be the main beneficiary of Will Fuller's absense early in the season. Strong has shown good skills in the red zone but has still been largely a disappointment since he was drafted. Unfortunately, the QB situation will ultimately cap his upside.
Curtis Samuel CAR (11)	86	57.63	6.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	If it wasn’t for John Ross breaking the NFL Combine record, people would be freaking out about Samuel’s 4.31 40 time. Unlike Ross however, Samuel is not a polished receiver. In fact, he might not even be a receiver as he spent his time splitting RB/WR duties in college. Think of Samuel as a weapon who will most likely start his career as a gadget player.
Laquon Treadwell MIN (9)	87	59.66	6.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Drafted in the 1st Round of the 2016 NFL Draft, Treadwell couldn’t have been anymore disappointing, ending the season with a single catch. He battled through injuries throughout the season, and at other times was simply wasn’t asked to suit up for games. Head coach, Mike Zimmer, makes incoming rookies earn playing time. With Michael Floyd suspended for the first 4 games, Treadwell should be the WR3 behind Diggs and Thielen. He needs to get on the field and make some sort of impact in real football, before we even think about fantasy.
Seth Roberts OAK (10)	88	58.17	4.67	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Amari Cooper owners hate Seth Roberts. He soaked up a number of red zone targets last season for the Raiders. The Raiders have added Cordarrelle Patterson and drafted Ishmael Zamora, so Roberts will have some competition in 2017 to be the WR3 for the Raiders offense.
Cooper Kupp LAR (8)	88	55.90	4.50	14.01	TIER 9	WR	Cooper Kupp won’t blow you away with his athleticism. Jared Goff won’t inspire you as his QB. That being said, Kupp is landing in a great spot for him because he fits the system so well. Expect Kupp to be involved early as a slot receiver for new coach Sean McVay who utilized that role so well last season with Jamison Crowder.
Chad Williams ARI (8)	88	56.17	5.83	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Chad Williams was a lesser known player out of a small school. However, he was also a 3rd round draft choice for Bruce Arians, a list that includes Emmanuel Sanders, John Brown, and T.Y. Hilton. If the Cardinals found yet another diamond in the rough, the opportunity will be there for Williams with Michael Floyd gone and Jaron Brown recovering from an ACL.
Paul Richardson SEA (6)	91	53.17	5.17	14.06	TIER 9	WR	Richardson is the 3rd or 4th WR on a Seattle offense, which has only supported one fantasy relevant receiver for years (Doug Baldwin). Tyler Lockett has shown flashes, and they also drafted Amara Darboh in the 3rd Round of this year’s NFL Draft.
Malcolm Mitchell NE (9)	92	50.40	6.50	0.00	TIER 9	WR	When on the field during his rookie season, Mitchell seemed to have chemistry with Brady. However, with plenty of weapons in New England, it’s hard to see Mitchell being a consistent fantasy producer without an injury to the receiving corps.
Michael Floyd MIN (9)	92	48.80	8.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	It seems that Michael Floyd has only disappointed since entering the league in 2012. A former 1st Round pick in the NFL Draft, Floyd has only been able to top 1000 yards once, and has never topped 65 receptions or 6 TDs. He's now been suspended for the first four games of the 2017 season for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.
Kendall Wright CHI (9)	92	50.20	6.17	0.00	TIER 9	WR	He’s been a PPR contributor during stretches of his 5 year career, with 94 catches and over 1000 yards back in 2013. However, he’s often battled injuries and hasn’t topped 64 receptions and 715 in the other 4 seasons. Targets are up for grabs in Chicago, but he can’t be counted on for any sort of consistent production.
Phillip Dorsett IND (11)	95	53.50	7.17	0.00	TIER 9	WR	The expectations were high after Dorsett was selected in the 1st Round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Colts. However, even with Donte Moncrief missing time, Dorsett’s first two seasons combined were for 51 catches, 753 yards, and 3 TDs. Now the Colts have brought in Kamar Aiken to potentially battle for the WR3 role.
Travis Benjamin LAC (9)	96	47.80	6.50	14.01	TIER 9	WR	He almost topped 1000 yards in 2015 with the Browns, so there was excitement for Benjamin’s potential as a Charger last season. He blew up in Week 2 with 115 yards and 2 TDs. However, he was the WR72 for the rest of the season, dealing with injuries. He’ll continue to have a splash play here and there but can’t be counted on in fantasy.
Taywan Taylor TEN (8)	97	46.62	5.67	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Taylor was a draft day value as most analysts thought he should have gone earlier in the draft. Unfortunately for Taylor, the Titans are a run first team who drafted Corey Davis at number 5 overall. With Richard Matthews, Davis, and Delanie Walker ahead of him, it will be tough for Taylor to produce in year one.
Dontrelle Inman LAC (9)	98	46.60	5.83	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Inman had some big weeks for the Chargers with Keenan Allen and Steve Johnson missing basically the entire season. In 2017, with Keenan Allen (healthy), Hunter Henry, Antonio Gates, and Tyrell Williams getting targets, it’s hard to see much of a role for Inman.
JuJu Smith-Schuster PIT (9)	98	45.13	5.83	0.00	TIER 9	WR	If there is one team known for drafting great WRs, it’s the Pittsburgh Steelers after they picked Antonio Brown, Mike Wallace, Emmanuel Sanders, and Martavis Bryant. Can JuJu be the next great draft-day selection? We think he could be with time, though it appears he will begin his career splitting time in the slot, something that doesn’t usually yield much fantasy value.
Kamar Aiken IND (11)	100	44.69	4.67	0.00	TIER 9	WR	When Aiken was basically the only show in town for Baltimore in 2015, he excelled finishing with 75 catches for 944 yards and 5 TDs. He didn’t see the field all that much in 2016 behind Mike Wallace and Breshad Perriman. However, he’s now competing for the WR3 role on the Colts. If Aiken can take that WR3 role, he could be in for a sneaky amount of targets on a high powered offense led by Andrew Luck.
Carlos Henderson DEN (5)	101	42.33	5.50	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Henderson is a favorite of WR-guru Matt Harmon. Henderson is electric on tape, reminiscent of Tyreek Hill with his big play ability. He is a bit more raw than the top receivers, but has the skills to have a great career. The biggest problem right now is that he is behind Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders with very few targets left to spare.
Mike Williams LAC (9)	102	41.00	7.17	0.00	TIER 9	WR	The Los Angeles Chargers shocked most people when they took Mike Williams with the 7th overall pick in the NFL Draft. Williams is a big strong receiver who turns 50/50 balls into 80/20 balls. While the talent is there and the QB is there, so are plenty of other pass catchers. The biggest concern is that he's been hampered by a back injury and hasn't been able to practice with Rivers and the offense this offseason. There were mentions of him possibly missing the entire season.
Mack Hollins PHI (10)	102	36.49	5.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Mack Hollins is a decently interesting rookie. He is a decent athlete, especially when considering his size. Since the Eagles shipped out Jordan Matthews, it wouldn't be shocking to see Hollins make some noise and get time in front of Nelson Agholor or Torrey Smith. He's not worth drafting, but could be a waiver wire consideration at some point this year.
Sammie Coates PIT (9)	104	40.53	6.90	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Sammie was the #1 waiver add back in Week 6 of last season. However, a nasty finger injury hampered the rest of his season, and made him a non-factor. There’s a lot of competition for targets in the Steelers receiving corps between Martavis Bryant, Sammie Coates, Eli Rogers and incoming rookie, JuJu Smith-Schuster.
Braxton Miller HOU (7)	104	34.03	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Braxton Miller is expected to continue to man the slot, even in the absense of Will Fuller. Miller has a ton of physical skills but is still a raw WR in a low volume passing attack.
Tajae Sharpe TEN (8)	106	30.44	7.83	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Tajae Sharpe, a clear example of why not to get too excited about Preseason production. After gaining fantasy hype with a strong preseason, he finished his rookie season in 2016 as the WR74. Fellow Titans WR, Rishard Matthews, had a mini-breakout. Then in the 2017 NFL Draft, the Titans selected top WR prospect, Corey Davis, in the 1st Round AND Taywan Taylor in the 3rd Round. All this before they signed talented WR, Eric Decker. Sharpe is not fantasy relevant and will be battling for the WR4 position.
Chris Godwin TB (11)	107	28.53	6.67	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Chris Godwin excels at contested catches as seen in his Reception Perception metrics. He is also a freak-athlete with a 95th percentile SPARQ score. His future looks bright being paired with Jameis Winston, but he’ll take a backseat this season to Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, Cameron Brate, and O.J. Howard.
Bruce Ellington HOU (7)	108	27.13	7.50	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Ellington was a deep sleeper candidate for some headed into 2016, but missed all of the season due to injury. He’s now bounced around the league but has landed in Houston.
Chad Hansen NYJ (11)	109	24.43	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	With Decker out of town, Hansen COULD be fantasy relevant in 2017. Other Jets receivers include Quincy Enunwa, Charone Peake, and rookie ArDarius Stewart. While the offense could stuggle mightily this season and the QB situation is rough, there are targets up for grabs.
Amara Darboh SEA (6)	110	18.03	6.17	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Darboh was missed by many fantasy analysts this offseason, but the Seattle Seahawks took him in the 3rd round of the NFL draft indicating they believe pretty highly in him. His film is good and he finds himself with one of the better QBs in the league. The question will really become about whether or not this is the year Russell Wilson opens it up or if the Seahawks return to their running ways.
Brian Quick WAS (5)	111	19.93	6.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Quick joins a packed Redskins receiving corps with Terrelle Pryor, Jamison Crowder, Josh Doctson and #1 target, Jordan Reed. Without an injury or two ahead of him, Quick won’t be fantasy relevant.
Chris Moore BAL (10)	112	11.96	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Chris Moore was a 4th round selection last year for the Ravens that many people believed could make some noise. He didn't. Now with Maclin in town, there's not a fantasy relevant role for Moore unless an injury happens.
Michael Campanaro BAL (10)	113	11.13	7.83	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Campanaro is a sparq freak as an athelete registering in the 96th percentile among NFL players. He also registers on 96% of injury reports. He was injured in college and has been injured in the NFL. He has the talent and opportunity, but only if he can stay healthy, which is a long shot.
Leonte Carroo MIA (11)	114	7.10	7.97	0.00	TIER 9	WR	He’s buried on the WR depth chart for Miami, who had the least amount of Pass plays in the league last season.
Anquan Boldin FA	115	0.00	5.67	14.03	TIER 9	WR	Sources say that Boldin has informed the Bills that he is now retiring.
Dorial Green-Beckham FA	116	0.00	10.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	He has been a disappointment since being drafted in the 2nd Round of the 2015 NFL Draft by Tennessee. Now the Eagles the released him.
Quincy Enunwa NYJ (11)	117	0.00	4.00	0.00	TIER 9	WR	Out for the season.
Rob Gronkowski NE (9)	1	177.67	7.67	2.07	TIER 1	TE	Gronk was absolutely ridiculous last year. Even more ridiculous than usual, improving on his 14.6 yards per reception average to an astronomical 21.6YPR. Once again though, Gronk burned too bright and couldn’t finish the season. The positive spin, he could actually drop to a point in drafts where his cost is worth jumping in as we’ve never advised taking him with a 1st. When healthy, he’s the most dominant positional advantage you can have.
Jordan Reed WAS (5)	2	144.62	8.50	5.09	TIER 2	TE	New year, the same story with Jordan Reed. He’s the centerpiece of a high powered offense when healthy, but he is frequently off the field with an injury. This past year was even worse for fantasy players when Reed continued to play through his shoulder injury and was all but useless. Seven of his twelve games he had 7+ targets, including five games with double-digit targets. In PPR scoring, a healthy Reed can even keep pace with the mythological Gronk.
Travis Kelce KC (10)	3	138.10	3.50	4.04	TIER 3	TE	Kelce finally came through for an entire season and finished as the overall TE1. Unfortunately, his 180 fantasy points would have only been good enough for TE5 in 2015. We also saw his true dominance take off when Jeremy Maclin was injured, going up 3 targets and over 30 yards a game. Perhaps Coach Reid and Alex Smith saw what they needed to commit to getting Zeus the ball more. Unfortunately, Kelce won’t be any kind of a value in drafts after his top finish.
Tyler Eifert CIN (6)	3	137.37	7.67	6.07	TIER 3	TE	Another often injured TE for the list! For a hot/cold player, he was mostly hot during his short-lived 2016 season. From Weeks 8-14, he was the top scoring TE on a per game average. The ability is there, there’s no question about that. The health is a massive concern. However, with injury-concern players like Gronk and Reed going a few rounds in front of him, Eifert provides a similar upside as those guys but a smaller draft investment.
Greg Olsen CAR (11)	5	128.83	2.33	5.03	TIER 3	TE	Olsen was a victim of overperforming to start last season. He finished the year as a top-3 TE. He was once again over 1000 yards. His first six games had him on a pace of 100+ receptions and over 1600 yards. Clearly not a sustainable pace. The yearly TD total was also lower than one should expect from Olsen. Now the offense is changing. The team added hybrid weapons Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel. Will Olsen continue to be the focal point of the passing offense?
Jimmy Graham SEA (6)	6	128.74	5.67	5.10	TIER 3	TE	Graham came back with a vengeance last year. Many athletes have suffered a torn patellar tendon and never returned. Graham was back the next year and very fantasy relevant. His receiving yards did come way down during the 2nd half of the year, perhaps he simply wore down. The Seahawks may not be a huge volume offense, but Russell Wilson is very efficient. Graham has a clear path to repeat TE1 numbers.
Kyle Rudolph MIN (9)	7	113.53	2.33	8.10	TIER 4	TE	Rudolph finally found a QB who can appreciate his talents in Sam Bradford. He finished as the overall TE2 and is still pulling in little respect from the fantasy community. His production of 83/840/7, while high considering his past career, is not outlier high considering his draft pedigree. There’s a world where Rudolph completely falls back to his previous career highs, but he’s going so late in drafts it doesn’t matter. Grab him late, then move on if necessary.
Zach Ertz PHI (10)	8	110.26	4.67	9.10	TIER 4	TE	Ertz once again closed out the year with Godzilla-like destruction. Over the final four games, he was the overall no.1 TE, and it wasn’t even close. The Eagles went out and made a WR splash in free agency, adding Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith. Carson Wentz will have other capable weapons to throw to, unlike last year, cough-cough, Nelson Agholor and Green-Beckham. Ertz is still a decent flier, but the hope that existed at the end of last year should be tempered.
Hunter Henry LAC (9)	9	107.00	5.00	9.06	TIER 4	TE	Henry crashed onto the scene last year with eight TDs. That’s the second most by a rookie TE, behind only Gronk. The bad news was he only pulled in 36 receptions, speaking to an unsustainable TD%. Now fantasy players are going crazy for Henry. The team spent a top-10 draft pick on Mike Williams, who has been injuried during the offseason thus far, and Antonio Gates is returning. Henry will have to take a big step in playtime and production to come close to his draft price.
Martellus Bennett GB (8)	10	101.43	4.67	7.06	TIER 5	TE	People are very excited for Bennett to come into Green Bay. He’s coming off one of the better years of his career and now gets to play with Aaron Rodgers. Well, people were excited for Jared Cook last year. To be fair to Cook, he only played in 10 games, but he was an afterthought in nearly every game he played. Bennett may be a better TE, but Rodgers doesn’t heavily utilize the position like Tom Brady does. He’s going to have a big week here and there, but Bennett is a candidate to be over drafted and disappoint fantasy owners.
Delanie Walker TEN (8)	11	101.47	4.00	7.09	TIER 5	TE	Walker is what he is at this point. And that’s a 65/800/6 type of guy. The Titans added Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor in the draft. Gone are the days of Walker as the de facto top passing game option. Walker is fine and won’t crap your team, but a top-5 finish is not in the realm of probable outcomes despite his mid-round draft price.
Jack Doyle IND (11)	12	94.13	4.67	12.01	TIER 5	TE	While everyone kept waiting for Dwayne Allen to break out, Jack Doyle was the one who did the breaking! It wasn’t a push into elite status by any means, but he showed he has fantasy value. This included a game of 9/78/1 when the majority of the team was injured and Doyle became a focal point. The Colts gave him an extension and traded Dwayne Allen to the Patriots. The Colts other TE, Erik Swoope, will likely eat into Doyle's value, but Jack could be a low-end TE1.
Coby Fleener NO (5)	13	92.23	4.67	13.12	TIER 6	TE	Just erase what happened with Coby Fleener for 2016. It’s gross and it’s not worth holding onto. Perhaps he needed a full year to acclimate to the Saints offense. He’s a late round TE that is playing with a top fantasy QB in Drew Brees and that team lost over 100 targets when they traded Brandin Cooks. There’s no high draft premium to pay for Fleener this year. Then again, perhaps he’s just that bad.
Eric Ebron DET (7)	14	87.35	6.50	12.05	TIER 6	TE	Ebron is widely viewed as a disappointment for fantasy players. This viewpoint exists despite finishing with 61/711, a 16 game pace of 75/875. And that pace includes the Thanksgiving goose egg disaster. The kicker for Ebron was the lack of touchdowns. He caught one Week 1, but that was it… for the year. He has improved every year and he’s basically free in drafts. He’s a great late round target.
Charles Clay BUF (6)	15	83.87	4.00	0.00	TIER 6	TE	Something very strange happened after the Bills bye week. They decided late in the season to focus on getting Clay the ball. If you were one of the lucky ones that picked him up for the playoff run, he was a major part of your championship. The team has kept him around despite him being on a bloated contract and having knee problems, but the Bills need good pass catchers. | Now with all the shakeups at WR, trading away Watkins and replacing him with Jordan Matthews, it’s possible Clay’s role grows.
Antonio Gates LAC (9)	16	81.33	4.33	14.05	TIER 6	TE	The man wants the tight end touchdown record and wants it to himself! Gates was able to tie Tony Gonzalez record last season, but couldn’t pull ahead. Gates has certainly slowed down, coming into his 15th NFL season, so don’t expect Madden numbers. He can still piece together a low-end TE1 season with touchdowns. Gates is facing more competition than he’s used to with the emergence of Hunter Henry and the addition of Mike Williams in the draft. But, Mike Williams has missed most of the offseason with injury woes. Gates could still end up being a late round value in fantasy.
Jason Witten DAL (6)	17	83.53	2.00	13.09	TIER 6	TE	The man has been a TE1, every, single, year, since 2004. That’s complete lunacy. His ceiling is likely once again a low-end TE1, mostly because in the war of attrition Jason Witten is king! He did establish himself as a preferred target from Dak Prescott and will be free in drafts. There’s just very little upside on a week to week basis.
Austin Seferian-Jenkins NYJ (11)	18	78.80	8.00	0.00	TIER 6	TE	In a recent article, ASJ talked of his struggles with alcohol. He has sought treatment and appears that he’s committed once again to football. He has dropped 25 lbs, and according to the report is the showing as the best TE on the team. He came out of school as a 2nd round pick and incredibly athletic. If the Jets do give him another chance, there’s a possibility he can finally reach his potential.
Austin Hooper ATL (5)	19	74.47	5.17	13.10	TIER 6	TE	The Falcons brought the 3rd round pick around slowly. Hooper didn’t start seeing consistent snaps until Week 8. The ability for big plays is there as shown in his 14.3 yards per reception and plays like his highlight TD catch in the Super Bowl. While the fantasy community is buzzing about Hunter Henry, Austin Hooper could be the sophomore TE to pay attention to.
Dwayne Allen NE (9)	20	72.50	5.67	13.09	TIER 7	TE	Allen was traded to the Patriots just one year after signing his contract extension with the Colts. Allen now joins the long list of decent-to-solid backups TEs that have played for the Pats. It should be status quo for Allen, some big games here and there but no production with any consistency. As with all Pats backup TEs, he carries that Gronk handcuff value. Let the rest of your league worry about Allen.
Julius Thomas MIA (11)	21	72.15	5.67	13.11	TIER 7	TE	Thomas was a failed experiment for the Jaguars. Now he rejoins Coach Adam Gase, the man who was calling the shots when Thomas had those prolific years in Denver. Ryan Tannehill has never shown a huge affinity to target the TE. The passing volume will be low with Jay Ajayi being the feature of the offense. Do not attempt to rekindle the fantasy flames with Thomas, he’s not worth it.
David Njoku CLE (9)	21	74.03	5.33	0.00	TIER 7	TE	Of the rookie TEs, Njoku is in the best volume situation. The Browns may be the worse team, but there’s no competition in front of him. The team immediately released Gary Barnidge after the draft. The passing weapons the Browns have are Corey Coleman and Kenny Britt. Njoku is a pro-ready prospect, but he will still need time to develop, as well as the team developing a stronger offense. The long term prognosis looks better than the short.
Evan Engram NYG (8)	23	69.67	5.67	14.01	TIER 8	TE	The Giants were on the clock with a big need at TE, and the most well-rounded TE in the class, David Njoku, was on the board. So... of course, the team selected Evan Engram. Engram profiles out strictly as a move tight end. He’s lacking the size to be a dominant blocking TE, but he’s incredibly athletic and will be a passing mismatch all over the field. That’s, of course, if that is why the Giants selected him. The news coming from the Giants coaching staff talking about how Engram will be used as prototypical TE is troubling. Hopefully, the team comes to their senses and uses his strengths. For fantasy this year, Engram will be pretty far down the pecking order with Beckham, Marshall, Shepherd, Vereen still in line for targets.
Jesse James PIT (9)	24	70.17	4.67	0.00	TIER 8	TE	James got a perceived upgrade earlier in the offseason when the Steelers released Ladarius Green. Yes, in games James has played without Green he’s better: less than 1 target and around 3 yards better. If the team wasn’t loaded with weapons, James could have some potential besides the occasional TD here and there. But with Brown, Bryant, Coates, Rogers, Smith-Schuster, Bell… It’s not likely to happen for James.
Zach Miller CHI (9)	25	64.71	6.00	0.00	TIER 8	TE	These numbers are going to shock you. Last year, Zach Miller played in 10 games. In that time (Weeks 1-11), Miller was the TE5. Both the games played and fantasy output is a bit startling. Miller is the ultimate in injury risk, but the Bears are lacking in proven pass catchers. Unfortunetly, Miller has been hurt this offseason and there have been rumors of him being released. The team did add Dion Sims in free agency and drafted Adam Shaheen. Monitor the camp battle and preseason. If Miller comes out with the starting job, he’s going to have fantasy value.
Cameron Brate TB (11)	26	61.13	4.67	13.08	TIER 8	TE	After having a solid season the Buccaneers rewarded Brate by drafting a player who will steal his playing time in OJ Howard. Brate’s real fantasy value came from touchdowns, and things have gotten a lot harder for him to replicate last year’s numbers. The team has added the aforementioned Howard, Desean Jackson, and Chris Godwin. He will be a TD-dependent TE2.
C.J. Fiedorowicz HOU (7)	26	62.88	4.67	0.00	TIER 8	TE	The Mad Hatter became a thing last year after becoming a go-to target for Brock Osweiler. From Weeks 4-17 has on a 100+ target pace. Unfortunately, the production did not match the volume, because Brock isn’t good. Fiedorowicz will be competing with Ryan Griffin for those sweet TE targets, and it’s going to be tough for him to have more than streamer potential.
Jared Cook OAK (10)	26	62.33	5.33	14.03	TIER 8	TE	He flamed out as Green Bay’s big offseason addition last year. Now Cook will try things with the Oakland Raiders. Don’t draft Cook. Sit back while he inevitably has one monster game and becomes the waiver wire hotness. Don’t add him to your team when this happens. Continue to sit back, then mock the team that wasted FAAB on perennial mediocrity and laugh some more when they eventually drop Cook back to the waiver wire.
Vance McDonald SF (11)	29	60.93	4.67	0.00	TIER 8	TE	It was a slow start for VMac, but he was enjoying a midseason breakout until going down with an injury. He was rewarded last year with a contract by the old regime, but now it sounds like the new regime would like him to get out of town. McDonald has never lacked athletic ability but has been a disappointment considering his 2nd round draft pedigree. It’s not clear where, or if, McDonald fits into Coach Shanahan’s offensive plan. There's been a lot of hype about 2017 5th round pick, George Kittle, during OTAs.
Benjamin Watson BAL (10)	30	58.57	6.67	0.00	TIER 8	TE	The veteran experienced a late year breakout that only Drew Brees could provide back in 2015. He became the go-to passing weapon and finished with 74/825/6. Ben’s success was a big reason for Coby Fleener’s 2016 hype. Watson’s play in ‘15 earned him a nice contract with Baltimore but it was not to be as he tore his achilles in the preseason. Watson wasn’t expected to continue his fantasy production before the injury, but he could be a nice streaming option in 2017.
O.J. Howard TB (11)	30	56.02	4.67	11.08	TIER 8	TE	Howard is an absolute monster of a man. He’s 6’6”, 251lbs, and ran a 4.51 40-yard dash. He’s unfathomably gifted. For his career, he seems to have landed in a terrific place when the Buccaneers drafted him in the first round. For this season though, it’s hard to expect a lot from him. Cameron Brate is still around, so it’s not a plug and play starter situation for Howard. And the hype around Howard is likely to lead to him being overdrafted.
Jermaine Gresham ARI (8)	32	57.80	4.00	0.00	TIER 8	TE	Big Gresh! There was a decent stretch of the 2016 season where Gresham actually had low-level fantasy value. Coach Arians doesn’t historically run a system that’s favorable for fantasy TEs. However, the Cardinals were depleted of weapons last year, forcing Gresh into a larger role. He did re-sign with the team, but his usage last year was likely a product of necessity.
Vernon Davis WAS (5)	33	51.47	4.33	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Apparently, Vernon Davis isn’t done yet! He had a decent year for a backup TE 44/583/2. He wasn’t someone that could be counted on week to week, but he filled in nicely when Jordan Reed was out. Similar to the option to handcuff Gronk, Davis goes from waiver trash to a useable TE in the event that Reed goes down.
Gerald Everett LAR (8)	34	49.55	6.33	0.00	TIER 9	TE	When Jordan Reed’s former Offensive Coordinator uses his first draft pick on a TE, people are going to notice. Coach Sean McVay has taken over the Rams and made drafting Everett his top priority. Everett has top level athleticism and excellent college production. He’s still a rookie TE that will need time to acclimate, but he could become a midseason pickup if things bounce the right way. He would only need to beat out Tyler Higbee to start earning starter snaps.
Ryan Griffin HOU (7)	35	40.37	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	TE	The forgotten TE in Houston. His final line was not that far off of his counterpart CJ Fiedorowicz. Griffin is a solid player, but unlikely to have any fantasy value because of his opportunity.
Adam Shaheen  CHI (9)	36	35.47	6.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Shaheen is interesting right away because of the draft capital spent by the Chicago Bears. They used a second round pick on what didn’t seem like an overwhelming team need. They have Zach Miller and signed Dion Sims in the offseason. Still, keep an eye on the situation during training camp as there have been rumors of Zach Miller getting released before the season start. Shaheen is a project, but hopefully a guy we are talking about in the next few years.
A.J. Derby DEN (5)	37	37.00	5.67	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Derby is an interesting name this year. He was traded to the Broncos midseason from the Patriots. Denver has been searching for a TE option since Julius Thomas left, and the likes of Virgil Green, Vernon Davis, and Jeff Heuerman haven’t come through. There is a bit of buzz around Derby with new OC Mike McCoy bringing a friendly TE offense back to Denver. The team did add Jake Butt in the draft, but Butt is recovering from an ACL tear. Derby is a name to watch in preseason.
Josh Hill NO (5)	38	32.13	5.67	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Perhaps the best TE on the Saints?? Some were calling for a Hill breakout before the team added Coby Fleener last year. Then when Fleener appeared outmatched, those people once again championed Hill. To their credit, Hill did start to eat into Fleener’s snap totals, but he wasn’t producing for fantasy. He went down with a broken leg towards the end of the year but should be ready to start the year. He’s more of a black hole preventing a possible Fleener breakout than a potential TE1.
Tyler Higbee LAR (8)	39	27.78	5.67	0.00	TIER 9	TE	The offseason started great for Higbee. The Jeff Fisher era was brought to an end, the team brought in Sean McVay, the man calling plays for the Jordan Reed breakout. But then the team used their first pick of the 2017 NFL Draft on Gerald Everett, another TE. Higbee watched his chance at true fantasy value get tossed to the ground and lit on fire.
Dion Sims CHI (9)	39	28.50	6.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Sims is a decent player, but a breakout at this point is unlikely to come. We do have some recent examples like Gary Barnidge and Ben Watson proving veterans can perform in the right situation. It’s in the realm of possibilities we’re talking about Sims as a midseason pickup. His QB, Mike Glennon, has been known to target the TE. Zach Miller, the likely starter, has massive injury problems. There have even been rumors that Miller could be released before the season starts. There aren’t any proven pass-catching weapons on the team. While Sims is not a draft target right now, remember his name.
Clive Walford OAK (10)	41	27.03	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	TE	There was some hope that Walford could emerge as a fantasy force when Oakland drafted him in the 3rd. But those dreams appear to be gone with no sign of progression last year and the team adding veteran Jared Cook through free agency.
Jake Butt DEN (5)	42	18.87	7.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Butt was widely considered an early round draft prospect until he suffered his second torn ACL in the Orange Bowl. He was eventually drafted by the Denver Broncos, a team that does have a need at the TE position. By all accounts, Butt’s recovery is going well. But, he shouldn’t be considered for any redraft leagues.
Lance Kendricks GB (8)	43	19.73	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Kendricks always gave you just enough to raise the antennae and pay attention. Once he had your attention, he would let you down. He was cut this offseason by the Rams and picked up by the Packers. No fantasy value to see here.
Will Tye NYG (8)	44	21.53	5.33	0.00	TIER 9	TE	The Tye Fighter was on a lot of potential breakout lists last year. He rewarded those people with an average line of 3/25 (sad trombone). The Giants have been struggling for years to find a solid TE and showed their displeasure with the current production by spending their first pick in the NFL Draft on TE Evan Engram. Tye had no value before the pick, and he somehow actually has negative value now.
Ladarius Green FA	45	0.00	9.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Cut by the Steelers.
Dennis Pitta FA	46	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	After coming back from two devistating hip injuries, it appears Pitta has reached strike three. The Ravens have confirmed another dislocated hip, meaning Pitta's career is most likely over. | Pitta has been released by Baltimore.
Gary Barnidge FA	47	0.00	0.00	0.00	TIER 9	TE	Cut by Browns.
